Most interest rates have fallen since the In foreign exchange Committee meeting on March 31. markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined on balance over the intermeeting period. M2 and M3 contracted in March and April; and expansion in transactions balances, which had accounted for much of the growth in the broader aggregates over previous months, slowed markedly. Through April, expansion of M2 was slightly above and that of M3 was slightly below the lower ends of the ranges established by the Committee for the year.
