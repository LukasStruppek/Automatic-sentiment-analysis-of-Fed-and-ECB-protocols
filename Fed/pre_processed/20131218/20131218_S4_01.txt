 Committee members viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that the economy was expanding at a moderate pace Labor market conditions had improved in recent months, with monthly gains in payroll employment of more than 200,000 in October and November The unemployment rate had declined but remained elevated Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, while the recovery in the housing market slowed somewhat in recent months Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, although the extent of the restraint may have begun to diminish The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth would strengthen and the unemployment rate would gradually decline toward levels consistent with its dual mandate Moreover, members judged that the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market had become more nearly balanced, reflecting in part an easing of fiscal policy concerns and an improvement in the prospects for global economic growth Inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective, and this was seen as posing possible risks to economic performance Members anticipated that inflation would, over time, return to the Committee's 2 percent objective, supported by stable inflation expectations and stronger economic activity However, in light of their concerns about the persistence of low inflation, many members saw a need for the Committee to monitor inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation was moving back toward its longer-run objective
