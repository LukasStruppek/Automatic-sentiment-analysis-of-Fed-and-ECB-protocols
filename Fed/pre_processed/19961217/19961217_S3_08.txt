[' Inflation had remained subdued, but the members continued to view the risks as tilted toward increases in the future. Labor compensation costs clearly were rising at a faster pace in the context of persistently tight labor markets, and an upturn in core price inflation seemed quite possible at some point in the absence of some easing of pressures in labor markets. However, the members recognized that the increase in wage inflation had been significantly less than would have been anticipated on the basis of historical relationships with labor market conditions, and price performance also had been more favorable than those relationships would have suggested. In the circumstances, there was a good deal of uncertainty regarding the outlook for inflation, including the potential degree of utilization in labor markets, the associated pressures on labor costs, and the ability of firms to pass higher labor costs into prices in markets that generally continued to be described as highly competitive. With the economy operating in the neighborhood of its sustainable potential, relatively minor differences in overall economic growth could have a significant effect over time on whether inflation would tend to trend up or down.
