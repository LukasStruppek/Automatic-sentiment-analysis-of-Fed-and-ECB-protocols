[' The recent information on residential construction was mixed. Weakness in late summer and early fall evidently reflected the effects of earlier increases in mortgage interest rates, but some measures of housing activity in November indicated unexpected strength. In addition, reports from around the country pointed to uneven conditions ranging from further strength to some emerging weakness in regional housing markets. On balance, the statistical and anecdotal information was interpreted, by some members at least, as consistent with a tendency for housing activity to stabilize. In this view, a level of housing construction somewhat below the peak reached earlier in 1996 was likely to be sustained, buoyed in part by the recent decline in mortgage interest rates and the continuing rise in consumer incomes and favorable consumer sentiment.
