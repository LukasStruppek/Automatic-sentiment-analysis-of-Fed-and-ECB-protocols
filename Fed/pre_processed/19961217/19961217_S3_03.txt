[" In the Committee's discussion of developments in major sectors of the economy bearing on the outlook for business activity, members noted that consumer spending had picked up as expected after a lull during the summer months. Survey data and anecdotal reports suggested that consumer confidence was currently high, and there were widespread indications of robust retail sales during the early weeks of the holiday season, though holiday sales were always difficult to read at this stage. Thus far, however, sales of motor vehicles had not strengthened to the extent that was anticipated after full production was restored following a work stoppage at a major manufacturer. Members cited a number of factors--the rise in consumer debt burdens, tightening consumer credit standards, continued worker concerns about job security, and the satisfaction of earlier pent-up demands--that were tending to inhibit the growth in consumer spending and perhaps helped to explain why the sharp increases in stock market wealth had not been accompanied by stronger growth in such spending. The behavior of the stock market injected an additional note of uncertainty into the forecast for consumer spending and the economy more generally. The rise over recent years had been extraordinary and had brought market valuations to fairly high levels relative to earnings and dividends. In these circumstances, the members recognized the need to monitor with special care price movements in the stock market and asset markets more generally for their implications for consumer and other spending. On balance, favorable employment and income conditions seemed likely to foster a level of consumer spending that would provide key support for sustained economic expansion. "]
