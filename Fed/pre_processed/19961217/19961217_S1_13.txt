[' Consumer price inflation in October and November was lifted slightly by sizable advances in energy prices and, to a lesser degree, increases in food prices; however, consumer prices for items other than food and energy rose modestly during the two months. The rise in core consumer prices over the twelve months ended in November was somewhat smaller than it had been over the previous twelve months, although the total index registered a bigger advance as a result of larger increases in food and energy prices. At the producer level, prices of finished energy goods rose sharply in October and November while prices of finished foods advanced less rapidly. Excluding food and energy, prices of finished goods edged lower on balance over October and November, and in the twelve months ended in November, these prices rose substantially less than in the previous twelve months. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers were up considerably in November after edging down in October. The twelve-month rise in this index was somewhat larger than the advance over the previous twelve months. ']
