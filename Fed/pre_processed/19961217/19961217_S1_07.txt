[' Private-sector demand for labor remained solid in November. Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably further in November after an October surge, and the average workweek of private production or nonsupervisory workers retraced more than half of its October decline. Service industries recorded another large gain in employment despite a sharp drop in payrolls at help-supply firms, and the number of jobs in retail trade expanded further in November after a steep rise in October. In the goods-producing sector, employment in construction and manufacturing rose moderately. The civilian unemployment rate increased slightly, to 5.4 percent, in November. ']
