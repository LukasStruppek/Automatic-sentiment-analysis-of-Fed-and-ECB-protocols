[' Expansion of the broad monetary aggregates was relatively strong in November. Growth of M2 picked up, reflecting a sharp increase in demand deposits and smaller runoffs in other checkable deposits. Inflows to retail money market funds remained substantial. Expansion of M3 moderated somewhat from its brisk pace in October as growth in business demands for credit slowed and banks reduced their reliance on large time deposits and other managed liability components. For the year through November, M2 was estimated to have grown at a rate in the upper half of the Committees annual range, and M3 at a rate a little above the top of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded moderately on balance over recent months and remained in the middle portion of its range. ']
