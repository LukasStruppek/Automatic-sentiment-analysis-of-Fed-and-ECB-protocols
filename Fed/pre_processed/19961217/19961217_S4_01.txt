[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance while also retaining a bias toward restraint in the directive. An unchanged policy was warranted by the quite satisfactory performance of the economy and inflation and the uncertainties surrounding the outlook. Thus, while the longer-term risks might point toward rising inflation, there were reasonable prospects that inflation would remain contained, and any pickup in inflation, should it occur, was likely to be limited at least for a time. In the circumstances, the members concluded that watchful waiting remained the prudent course for policy as they continued to assess ongoing developments. Because the risks of waiting did not appear to be substantial at this juncture, anticipatory tightening was not yet called for. "]
