 In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in March suggested that economic growth slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting transitory factors The pace of job gains moderated, and the unemployment rate remained steady A range of labor market indicators suggested that underutilization of labor resources was little changed Although growth in household spending declined, households' real incomes rose strongly, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices, and consumer sentiment remained high Business fixed investment softened, the recovery in the housing sector remained slow, and exports declined Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, but this partly reflected earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable Despite the slower growth in output and employment observed of late, members continued to expect that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judged consistent with its dual mandate Members generally continued to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced Inflation was anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but members expected inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as further improvement in the labor market occurred and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipated In light of the uncertainties associated with the outlook for inflation, the Committee agreed that it would continue to monitor inflation developments closely
