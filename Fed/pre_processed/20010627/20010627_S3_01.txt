In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members noted that by some measures overall economic activity remained at a reasonably high level. However, recent data indicated that growth of spending and output was quite sluggish and below the pace many members had anticipated at the time of the previous meeting. Weakness in business spending for equipment and software, efforts to reduce excess inventories, and the ongoing adaptation to lower equity prices in the United States and around the world were likely to hold back economic activity in the short run. Nonetheless, the members continued to anticipate a strengthening as the year progressed and during 2002, fostered to a large extent by the lagged effects on spending of the substantial easing in monetary policy since early this year, the stimulus from recently enacted tax cuts, and the positive effects on household and business purchasing power of some recent reductions in energy prices. In addition, the abatement and eventual turnaround of the downward adjustments to capital spending and inventories would add impetus to economic growth going forward. It was noted, however, that the unique characteristics of the current cyclical experience, including the heavy concentration of weakness in business expenditures and manufacturing output, increased the uncertainty that surrounded any forecast. Most of the members believed that the risks to the expansion, notably for the nearer term, remained to the downside of current forecasts. Potential sources of shortfalls included the effects of possible further increases in unemployment on consumer and business confidence; the risks of disappointing business earnings that could damp investment and, through lower equity prices, consumption; and the growing indications of weakness in foreign economies that could limit demand for exports. In an environment of diminished pressures in product and labor markets and of lower energy costs, members commented that price pressures were likely to remain contained, at least over the near to intermediate term.
