The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity continued to grow little, if at all, in the second quarter. Employment fell somewhat over the first two months of the quarter, industrial output dropped sharply, and the limited available information suggested that both probably continued to decline in June. Expansion in consumer spending appeared to have slowed and business purchases of equipment and software had fallen appreciably, though homebuilding had been well maintained. Energy prices had been relatively flat recently, at a high level, and core price inflation had moderated a little.
