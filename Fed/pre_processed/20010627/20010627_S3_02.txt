In preparation for the mid-year monetary policy report to Congress, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks provided individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 2001 and 2002. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP had central tendencies of 1-1/4 to 2 percent for 2001, suggesting at least a little acceleration in the second half of the year, and 3 to 3-1/4 percent for 2002. The civilian rates of unemployment associated with these forecasts had central tendencies of 4-3/4 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2001 and 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2002. Forecasts of the rate of inflation, as measured by the chain price index for personal consumption expenditures, were centered on a range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent for this year and 1-3/4 to 2-1/2 percent in 2002.
