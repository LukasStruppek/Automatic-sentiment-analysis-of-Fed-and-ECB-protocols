Federal funds traded at rates near the Committee's target level over the intermeeting period. Other short-term market rates declined somewhat following the Committee's announcement of the easing action and subsequently moved down noticeably further in response to weaker-than-expected news on economic activity and corporate earnings. Yields on long-term Treasury and investment-grade corporate securities fell appreciably during the intermeeting interval, but rates on speculative-grade bonds rose sharply in response to the adverse earnings news. The pessimistic earnings reports also weighed on equity prices, which edged lower on balance.
