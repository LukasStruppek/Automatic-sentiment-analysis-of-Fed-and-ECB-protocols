A smaller easing move than those the Committee had been making earlier this year was deemed desirable by the members in light of the substantial easing that already had been implemented since the start of this year. By a number of measures--including the level of real federal funds rates, the robust growth of the monetary aggregates, and the ready availability of finance to most borrowers--policy had become stimulative. Such a policy stance was appropriate for a time to counter the various forces holding back economic expansion. But much of the lagged effects of the Committee's earlier easing actions had not yet been felt in the economy, and they would be supplemented in coming quarters by the implementation of the recently legislated tax cut stimulus. In these circumstances, a smaller move than those undertaken earlier this year would have the advantage of reducing the odds on adding to inflation pressures later and of underlining the Committee's assessment of its policy stance. In the view of a number of members, the Committee might well be near the end of its easing cycle. At the same time, several emphasized that they did not want to rule out further easing later if warranted by the tenor of incoming economic information.
