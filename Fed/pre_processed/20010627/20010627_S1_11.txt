The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services continued to shrink in April. The value of exports fell, with most of the drop occurring in capital goods, notably computers and semiconductors. The value of imports also decreased but by slightly more than exports, reflecting sizable declines in capital and consumer goods that were partly offset by increases in oil and automotive products. Recent information indicated that economic growth in the euro area and the United Kingdom in the first quarter was at about the reduced pace seen in the fourth quarter, and growth likely stayed relatively slow more recently. Expansion in Canada appeared to have weakened recently after a slight pickup in the first quarter. In Japan, the contraction in economic activity that began early in the year appeared to have continued into the second quarter. Most of the developing countries, with the notable exception of China, also were experiencing an economic slowdown that was related at least in part to weaker external demand.
