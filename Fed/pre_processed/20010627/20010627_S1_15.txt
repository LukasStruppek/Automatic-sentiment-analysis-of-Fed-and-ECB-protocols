In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of many of the major foreign currencies increased slightly over the intermeeting interval, as the dollar's appreciation against euro and other European currencies more than offset the U.S. dollar's further decline against the Canadian dollar. European currencies weakened in response to disappointing data on economic activity, with inflation concerns seen as constraining countervailing monetary easing actions. The dollar also was up slightly on net in terms of an index of the currencies of other important trading partners. The real was adversely affected by Brazil's internal problems and spillovers from Argentina's financial difficulties, while the Mexican peso benefited from continued foreign interest in Mexican investments and from high oil prices.
