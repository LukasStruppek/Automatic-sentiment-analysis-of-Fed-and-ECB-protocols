The rapid contraction in industrial production continued unabated in May, with manufacturing output registering an eighth consecutive monthly drop. Moreover, output from electric utility plants fell, and mining activity slowed further in May following a strong first-quarter gain. Within manufacturing, decreases in output were widely spread across sectors, and the production of high-tech equipment continued to plummet. The motor vehicle industry was one of the few sectors to record a rise in production. The further contraction in production in May brought the rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity to its lowest level since 1983.
