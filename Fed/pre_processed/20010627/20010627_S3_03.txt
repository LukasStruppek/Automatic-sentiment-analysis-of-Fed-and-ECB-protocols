Continuing softness in the expansion of economic activity was mirrored in anecdotal reports of business conditions in much of the nation. Typical regional reports referred to slowing increases in economic activity from an already reduced pace or to the persistence of sluggish business activity and generally downbeat business sentiment. Manufacturing continued to display particular weakness. However, actions to reduce excess inventories or to address problems relating to overcapacity in some sectors of the economy, including telecommunications and other high-tech industries, were under way and were likely to exert a decreasing drag on economic activity over coming quarters as corrective adjustments were completed. Financial conditions, while generally supportive of greater spending, presented a mixed picture in some respects. Short- and intermediate-term interest rates had fallen substantially this year, and long-term yields had moved down late last year. But equity prices were only holding their own after a substantial decline earlier and the dollar had appreciated. Though lenders were cautious about marginally creditworthy firms, most businesses were finding ample credit available at attractive terms.
