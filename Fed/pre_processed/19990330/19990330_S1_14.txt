Open market operations throughout the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the federal funds rate at around 4-3/4 percent. Market interest rates changed little immediately after the February meeting because market participants had expected the Committee's decision. Subsequently, however, Treasury yields moved up significantly in response to incoming data suggesting further robust growth in aggregate spending, and then retraced much of the rise after the receipt of favorable news on inflation. Short-term interest rates changed little on balance over the intermeeting interval, and longer-term rates rose somewhat. Key indexes of stock market prices recorded mixed changes.
