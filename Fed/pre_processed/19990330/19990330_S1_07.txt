Consumer spending surged in the early months of 1999, supported by rapidly rising disposable personal income, soaring household net worth, and buoyant consumer sentiment. Attractive pricing and the favorable trends in income and wealth contributed to strong underlying demand for motor vehicles, and substantial gains were recorded in most other categories of retail sales as well. Expenditures on services in January (latest available data) also exhibited strength, most notably in spending for energy services, which picked up after an unseasonably warm December.
