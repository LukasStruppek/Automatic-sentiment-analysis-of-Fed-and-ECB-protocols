The extraordinary expansion in business fixed investment in recent years, fueled to a major extent by purchases of new equipment, was also expected to moderate over time as a result of the large buildup and reduced utilization of capacity and the forecasted slower growth in final sales. While the prospect of further declines in the prices of some equipment would encourage continued growth in spending, the lower prices were not expected to outweigh the effects of relatively low capacity usage and more moderate growth in overall demand in coming quarters. In this regard, some signs of deceleration could be detected in the currently available data, though from extremely rapid rates of growth. With respect to commercial building, members reported strong construction activity in many areas, but some also noted that such construction appeared to have reached a peak, as evidenced in part by signs of overbuilding in a few areas. Moreover, current data suggested little or no growth in overall expenditures on nonresidential structures.
