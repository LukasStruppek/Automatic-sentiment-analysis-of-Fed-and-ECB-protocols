The trade-weighted value of the dollar in foreign exchange markets increased somewhat over the intermeeting period in relation to the currencies of a broad group of important U.S. trading partners. Much of the dollar's upward movement came against a subset of major currencies. A large rise in terms of the yen occurred in response to an easing of monetary policy by the Bank of Japan that reduced the overnight call rate to an extremely low level and fostered a considerable decline in Japanese bond yields. The dollar also rose substantially against the euro, which was weighed down by signs of continued weakness in Germany and, late in the period, by the outbreak of hostilities in the Balkans. Among the emerging countries, the Brazilian real depreciated on balance against the dollar, although it firmed late in the period as overall financial conditions in that country stabilized somewhat, and the Mexican peso appreciated against the dollar in association with a rebound in oil prices.
