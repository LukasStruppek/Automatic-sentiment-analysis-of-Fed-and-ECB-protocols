Total industrial production was unchanged in January and rose slightly in February. Gas and oil extraction slumped in January, and mild weather restrained utility output in February. Manufacturing production increased modestly in both months, reflecting strong increases in the output of high-tech industries that more than offset declines in the production of aircraft and of motor vehicles and parts. The factory operating rate fell further in the January-February period, as the growth in manufacturing capacity continued to outpace the rise in production.
