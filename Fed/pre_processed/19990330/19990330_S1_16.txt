Expansion of M2 and M3 moderated considerably on balance in the early months of 1999 from the rapid increases of the fourth quarter. The deceleration of these aggregates apparently reflected the waning effects of the policy easings of last autumn in narrowing the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets, a slowdown in mortgage refinancing activity, and a bounceback in household purchases of stock mutual funds as conditions in financial markets brightened. Both aggregates were estimated to have increased over the first quarter at rates somewhat above the Committee's annual ranges. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range.
