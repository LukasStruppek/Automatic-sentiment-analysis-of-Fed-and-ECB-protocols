The members saw little reason to anticipate any significant, continuing increase in inflation in the near term. Inflation was expected to rise, owing to the recent hikes in oil prices, but the increase should be limited. And with little evidence of rising pressures on prices at early stages of production or on nominal wages, inflation should remain contained for a time. However, some members were concerned about the risk that sustained rapid growth in aggregate demand would stretch markets even more. Even presuming that growth in economic activity would moderate to a pace close to the economy's potential, labor markets would remain relatively taut and at some point could trigger faster increases in labor compensation and, in turn, rising price inflation. Moreover, the dissipation or reversal of favorable supply factors--including, for example, in addition to energy prices the waning effects of the dollar's earlier appreciation--could contribute to higher inflation expectations and faster nominal compensation increases. In the view of some others, though, the impact on prices of the unwinding of the favorable factors might well be muted or offset by a possible further uptick in productivity growth. Accelerating productivity had been spurring investment in capacity and intense competition among businesses, and had been holding down labor costs. Furthermore, optimism about improving productivity was evident in projections of business profits and the high level of equity prices. In any event, it was clear that forecasts in recent years typically had overstated the rise in inflation, and a great deal of uncertainty surrounded the extent to which productivity gains and other factors, some unspecified, might continue to hold down inflation in a period of robust economic growth and relatively tight labor markets.
