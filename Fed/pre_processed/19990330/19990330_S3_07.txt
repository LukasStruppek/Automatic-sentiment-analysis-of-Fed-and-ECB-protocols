In the Committee's discussion of the outlook for inflation, members commented that they saw no evidence of any acceleration in price inflation despite the continuing strength of the economic expansion and the tightness of labor markets. Anecdotal reports from around the nation continued to underscore the difficulty or inability of most business firms to raise prices in highly competitive markets. There were a limited number of reports of relatively sizable increases in wages paid to workers with skills in especially short supply, but on the whole employers were successful in holding down increases in labor compensation and offsetting them through improvements in productivity. Indeed, increases in unit labor costs, at least in the nonfinancial corporate sector and perhaps more widely as well, had declined to a very low rate over the past year.
