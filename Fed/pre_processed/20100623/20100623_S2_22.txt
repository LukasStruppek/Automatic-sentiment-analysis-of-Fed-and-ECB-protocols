The threat to global economic growth and financial stability posed by the fiscal situation in some European nations sparked widespread flight-to-quality flows over most of the intermeeting period. This retreat led to a broad appreciation of the dollar as well as declines in equity prices abroad and in yields on benchmark sovereign bonds. However, investor sentiment improved near the end of the period, leading to a partial reversal in some of these movements, despite Moody's downgrade of Greece to below-investment-grade status in mid-June. On net, the dollar ended the intermeeting period up, most headline equity indexes fell, and benchmark government bond yields declined. Strains in euro-area bank funding markets reemerged during the period. In response, the ECB announced some changes to its liquidity operations that would provide greater market access to term funding in euros.. 3. .. Difficulties also appeared in corporate debt markets as both nonfinancial and financial corporate debt issuance dropped substantially in May. In addition, pressures in dollar funding markets reappeared for foreign financial institutions, especially those thought to have significant exposure to Greece and other peripheral euro-area countries. To help contain these pressures and to prevent their spread to other institutions and regions, the Federal Reserve reestablished dollar liquidity swap arrangements with the ECB, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, and the Swiss National Bank.
