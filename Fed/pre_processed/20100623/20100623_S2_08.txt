Consumer price inflation remained low in April and May. The core consumer price index rose only slightly over the period, and the year-over-year change in the index was lower than earlier this year. Core goods prices continued to decline, on net, and prices of non-energy services remained soft. The headline consumer price index edged down in both months, as the drop in the price of crude oil since April led consumer energy prices to retrace a portion of the run-up that occurred during the nine months ending in January. At earlier stages of processing, producer prices of core intermediate materials rose moderately in May after five months of large increases. Inflation compensation based on Treasury inflation-protected securities decreased recently in response to low readings on inflation and falling oil prices. Survey measures of both short- and long-term inflation expectations remained relatively stable.
