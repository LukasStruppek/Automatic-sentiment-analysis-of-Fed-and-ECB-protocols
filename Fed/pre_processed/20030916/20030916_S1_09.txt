Inventories contracted in the second quarter, and partial data for July suggested that the runoff continued into the third quarter. The book value of manufacturing inventories declined for the month, led by stocks of durable goods. However, inventories of wholesale goods edged up. Inventory shipment ratios for the manufacturing sector at book value moved down considerably in July, and book value inventory-sales ratios for wholesalers remained at very low levels by historical standards.
