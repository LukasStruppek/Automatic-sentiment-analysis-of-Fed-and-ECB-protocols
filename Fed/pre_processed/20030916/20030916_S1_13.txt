The Committee's decision to leave its target for the federal funds rate and assessment of risks unchanged at the August meeting was widely anticipated. On net over the intermeeting period, market expectations for the federal funds rate changed little. However, intermediate- and longer-term interest rates were volatile over the period, with yields on Treasury coupons declining slightly on balance. Yields on most investment-grade securities moved in line with those on Treasury obligations, but a more optimistic economic outlook among investors contributed to a substantial decline in speculative-grade yields. Broad stock price indexes rose notably, boosted by improved economic growth prospects and the associated upwardly revised expectations for earnings.
