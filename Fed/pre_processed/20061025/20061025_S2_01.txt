The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that growth of real GDP had slowed further in the third quarter, reflecting both a significant drag from the continuing contraction in residential construction and a steep decline in motor vehicle assemblies. Looking ahead, a gradual reduction in the restraining effects of the contraction in residential investment and further solid gains in consumer and business spending were expected to lead to a pickup in GDP growth through 2007 and into 2008. These gains in spending were likely to be supported by past declines in energy prices and continued gains in payroll employment and labor income. Real GDP was expected to rise at a somewhat slower rate over the next two years than in 2006 in part as a result of less impetus from household wealth, interest rates, and fiscal policy. The projected increase in real output over the next year or so was a little below the staff's estimate of potential output growth, leading to a lessening in pressures on resource utilization. Core inflation was anticipated to edge down in 2007 and 2008 relative to the second half of this year because of the diminishing impetus from the prices of energy and other commodities and because of the modest easing in resource utilization.
