Nonfarm payrolls rose modestly in September after a larger increase in August, with some of the variation apparently a result of seasonal factors. In September, job increases in the service-producing sectors were fairly widespread and were again led by the health-care industry. The construction sector also added jobs; the lift came from gains associated with nonresidential building that more than offset further losses in the residential sector. Job cutbacks in the retail trade and manufacturing sectors continued. Aggregate hours of private production or nonsupervisory workers again edged lower. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.6 percent in August.
