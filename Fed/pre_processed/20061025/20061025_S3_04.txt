Investment spending also appeared to be holding up well. Meeting participants reported that their business contacts were generally optimistic and perceived the economic outlook as relatively favorable. Several participants noted that growth in nonresidential construction remained robust and was absorbing some of the resources displaced from the residential sector. The strength of corporate balance sheets and profits was seen as likely to help maintain a solid profile for investment spending over the next year or so, despite some restraint from the slower growth in final sales. However, one participant observed that the uncertainty concerning the possible severity of the current slowing in economic growth could lead some businesses to delay investment plans.
