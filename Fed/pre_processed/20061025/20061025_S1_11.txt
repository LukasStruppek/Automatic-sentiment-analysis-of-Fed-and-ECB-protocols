The U.S. international trade deficit widened to another record in August, reflecting a surge in imports that more than offset a sizable jump in exports. The sharp increase in imports was driven importantly by oil and natural gas, but imports of capital goods and non-oil industrial supplies, particularly metals, also exhibited large gains. Imports of services fell back slightly. The increase in exports was led by capital goods, with aircraft, computers, semiconductors, and other machinery all climbing briskly. Exports of industrial supplies and consumer goods also rose strongly, while exports of services expanded modestly.
