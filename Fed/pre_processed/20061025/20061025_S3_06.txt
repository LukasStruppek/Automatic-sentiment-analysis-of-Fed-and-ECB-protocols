Both data and reports from businesses indicated that the labor market remained tight. Employment had continued to rise at a steady pace, and participants reported that many of their contacts were increasingly concerned about the difficulty of recruiting suitably qualified workers. Shortages were most pronounced for certain types of professional and skilled workers. These reports of shortages and the associated wage pressures had not unambiguously shown through in the aggregate compensation data, which were giving contradictory signals about whether compensation increases were picking up. However, the possibility that the tightness of the labor market could lead to a sustained increase in wage pressure was viewed by participants as an upside risk to costs and their expectations of a gradual decline in inflation. It was noted, though, that continuing high profit margins provided some scope for increased labor costs to be absorbed without necessarily leading to elevated price pressures.
