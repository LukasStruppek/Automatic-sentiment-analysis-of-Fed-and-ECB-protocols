In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted that incoming data over the relatively brief intermeeting period had come in broadly as anticipated. The most recent indicators suggested that economic growth had probably slowed more sharply in the third quarter than had been expected at the time of the September meeting, but that appeared to largely reflect the impact of temporary influences. Participants continued to expect the economy to expand at a rate close to or a little below the economy's long-run sustainable pace over coming quarters. The ongoing adjustment in the housing market was likely to depress real activity in the near term, but this effect was expected to wane gradually; private final domestic purchases had held up well in recent months and looked set to expand at a reasonably good pace. Although recent monthly inflation readings indicated some slowing of core inflation from the very rapid rates of spring and early summer, many participants noted that current rates of core inflation remained undesirably high. Most participants expected core inflation to moderate gradually, but they were quite uncertain as to the likely pace and extent of that moderation.
