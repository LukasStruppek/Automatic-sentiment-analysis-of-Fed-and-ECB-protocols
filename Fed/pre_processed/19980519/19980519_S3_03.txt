[' Despite the failure of domestic demand to moderate in line with their earlier expectations, the members were persuaded that appreciable slowing in the growth of economic activity was a likely prospect over the course of coming quarters even though its exact timing and extent were unknown. Key elements in this assessment were the outlook for inventories and net exports. The surge in inventory accumulation in the first quarter did not appear to have resulted in overall stock imbalances as evidenced by stock-sales ratios or anecdotal reports. Even so, growth in inventory investment at a pace sharply exceeding the sustainable growth of final sales was unlikely to continue for an extended period. Given the ample availability of industrial capacity and the related absence of pressures on lead or delivery times, business firms did not need to build precautionary stocks. Thus, inventory investment was likely to respond to the expected deceleration in final sales over coming quarters. Some members expressed reservations about the probable extent of the deceleration in the period ahead, especially in the context of their expectations of a still relatively robust uptrend in final sales.
