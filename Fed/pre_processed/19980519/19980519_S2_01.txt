[' The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that the expansion of economic activity would slow considerably during the next few quarters and remain moderate in 1999. Reduced growth of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the sizable rise that had occurred in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place substantial restraint on the demand for U.S. exports and to add to the pressures on domestic producers to hold down prices to meet import competition. An anticipated sharp slowdown in the pace of inventory accumulation also would damp domestic production as the growth of stocks was brought into balance with the expected more moderate trajectory of final sales. The staff analysis suggested that further strong gains in income, along with the surge in household net worth over the past several years, would support brisk, though gradually diminishing, gains in consumer spending. Housing demand, fostered by the favorable cash flow affordability of home ownership, was expected to remain at a generally high level, though the anticipated slowing in income growth over the projection period would damp residential construction activity somewhat. Substantial increases in capital spending would continue, but slower growth in business sales and profits would produce a gradual deceleration. While pressures on production resources were likely to abate to a degree as output growth slowed, inflation was expected to increase somewhat from its recent pace in response to rising compensation costs associated with persisting tightness in labor markets, a limited rebound in energy prices, and a diminishing drag on non-oil import prices.
