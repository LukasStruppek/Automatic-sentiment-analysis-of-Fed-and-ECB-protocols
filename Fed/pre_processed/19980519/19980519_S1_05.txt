[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy continued to expand rapidly in 1998. Strength in consumption, business outlays for durable equipment, and homebuilding boosted growth in domestic final demand to a very rapid pace in the first quarter, and there had been indications of slower expansion since then. However, weakening net exports were exerting a considerable drag on economic growth. Moreover, the extraordinary pace of inventory investment thus far this year might foreshadow less robust expansion ahead. Payroll employment remained on a brisk uptrend, but industrial production decelerated sharply after surging in the second half of last year. Despite indications of persisting pressures on employment costs associated with tight labor markets, consumer price inflation remained subdued, importantly reflecting large declines in energy prices.
