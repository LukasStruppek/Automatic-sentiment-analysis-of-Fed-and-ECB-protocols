[' Industrial production rose somewhat over March and April after weakening earlier in the year. Part of the slowdown this year, following rapid growth in the second half of last year, was attributable to weakness in utility output associated with unusually warm winter weather across much of the country. More importantly, though, manufacturing output had changed little on balance in recent months. In April, a pickup in the production of business equipment, particularly of information processing equipment, was largely offset by further declines in the output of construction supplies, basic metals, and nondurable materials. The production of consumer goods was unchanged. The factory operating rate eased further in April, reflecting the continuing brisk expansion in manufacturing facilities and slow growth in output. ']
