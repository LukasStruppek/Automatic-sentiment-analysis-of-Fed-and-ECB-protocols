[" In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period ahead, a majority of the members indicated that they preferred or could accept an unchanged policy. These members also expressed a preference for retaining the asymmetric instruction in the directive that the Committee had adopted at the previous meeting. In this view, the uncertainties in the outlook for economic expansion and inflation remained sufficiently great to warrant a continued wait-and-see policy stance. Considerations underlying this view included the possibility that financial and economic conditions in Asia might worsen further and exert a stronger retarding effect on the performance of the U.S. economy than presently seemed to be in train. A good deal of uncertainty also surrounded the potential extent to which developments in the domestic economy, notably the pace of inventory accumulation over coming months, might foster slower economic expansion and the related degree to which pressures in labor markets would be affected. Moreover, considerable questions remained about the relationship of labor market pressures to inflation. In these circumstances, it was possible that inflation would continue to be contained, though the risks clearly seemed to be tilted in the direction that action would become necessary at some point to keep inflation low.
