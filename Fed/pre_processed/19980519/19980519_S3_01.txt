[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members noted the exceptional strength in domestic final demand and viewed robust further expansion in such demand as highly likely. Final purchases were being supported by accommodative financial conditions, especially a rising equity market, by ebullient consumer sentiment, and by business spending on productivity-enhancing equipment. While there were limited indications of weakness in some sectors of the economy--such as manufacturing, energy, and agriculture in some areas--the members did not see conclusive evidence of appreciable moderation in the pace of the overall economic expansion. Nonetheless, they generally believed that substantial moderation in the expansion was a likely prospect in coming quarters, largely as a consequence of a marked slowing in inventory investment from the clearly unsustainable pace of the first quarter and, to a lesser extent, from some further weakness in net exports. The outlook for the latter was especially uncertain, and the weakness could be greater than previously anticipated owing to renewed turmoil in emerging Asian economies and pronounced weakness in Japan. Whether the moderation in U.S. economic growth would be sufficient to forestall cost increases arising from tight labor markets that in turn would add to pressures on prices was open to question. To date, developments in business costs had been relatively benign, owing to an important extent to somewhat faster productivity growth. This circumstance and a number of one-time influences holding down costs and prices had contained inflation at rates that were lower than those seen in several decades, and probably would continue to do so for a while. But the members generally were concerned that inflation might begin to rise over the intermediate term, especially if labor markets tightened further. "]
