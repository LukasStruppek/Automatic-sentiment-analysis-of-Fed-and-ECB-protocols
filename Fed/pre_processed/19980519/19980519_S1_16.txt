[' M2 and M3 expanded briskly further in April, but data for late April and early May showed M2 declining and M3 leveling out; much of the fluctuation in M2 during the April-May period appeared to be related to movements of funds associated with unusually heavy nonwithheld tax payments and a surge in mortgage refinancings to take advantage of lower long-term rates. On balance, the underlying growth of these aggregates seemed to be slowing from the pace of the first quarter. The moderation in M3 partly reflected a reduced need for non-M2 sources of funds at a time when bank credit expansion seemed to be slowing. Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt apparently had slipped somewhat after picking up earlier in the year. ']
