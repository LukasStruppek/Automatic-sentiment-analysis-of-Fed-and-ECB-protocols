[" The Manager informed the Committee of his intention to discuss with market participants proposed changes in the procedures for lending securities from the System Open Market Account. The changes would be intended to adapt the lending program to the evolving structure of the U.S. Treasury securities market. They are designed to make System securities lending more effective at helping to relieve occasional significant shortages of particular securities, which could cause disruptions to the market. In a brief discussion, Committee members sought clarification of some of the proposed details of the new program and how it would fit with the Federal Reserve's broader responsibilities. Action to amend paragraph 2 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations would be required at a later date when the details of the new program had been decided upon after discussions with market participants.
