[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had continued to grow at a rapid pace in recent months. The further advance reflected moderating but still sizable increases in business fixed investment and consumer spending and an upturn in business inventory accumulation. Housing demand remained at a high level, and deepening trade deficits provided only a partial offset to the strength in domestic spending. Against this background, employment and production posted further large gains. Price inflation remained subdued despite tight labor markets and some pickup in the rate of wage increases. ']
