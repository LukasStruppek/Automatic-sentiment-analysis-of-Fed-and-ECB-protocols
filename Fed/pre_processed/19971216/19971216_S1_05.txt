[' Industrial production continued to advance at a brisk pace in October and November. The November increase was widespread across market groups. It featured particularly strong growth in the production of durable goods, including a surge in the output of motor vehicles and parts. Partly offsetting the strength in the manufacturing sector in November was a decline in mining activity and in utilities output after two months of robust expansion. The large rise in production boosted the rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity to its highest level in more than two years. ']
