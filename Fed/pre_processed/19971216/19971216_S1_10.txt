[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was significantly larger in the third quarter than in the second. Exports of goods and services rose only marginally in the third quarter, as increases in machinery, industrial supplies, and service receipts were nearly offset by sharp declines in exports of aircraft and gold. Imports of goods and services rose appreciably in the third quarter; the increases were in most major trade categories and included strong further advances in the quantity of oil imports. Economic growth in most major foreign industrial countries was relatively vigorous in the third quarter, and preliminary indicators for the fourth quarter suggested continued above-trend expansion. However, growth since midyear appeared to have recovered only modestly in Japan from a sharp second-quarter decline. The ongoing financial turmoil affecting a number of Asian economies had led to a significant slowdown in economic activity in the region. Available data also suggested a favorable economic performance in major Latin American countries in the third quarter. ']
