[' In their comments on recent developments in labor markets, the members emphasized the very limited supply of new workers and the extraordinary tightness prevailing in markets throughout the nation. Several reported that the scarcity of available workers was limiting the growth of economic activity in some parts of the country and that some employers were trying out novel approaches aimed at enticing people not currently seeking a job to enter the work force. While wage increases remained moderate on balance, larger increases were gradually becoming more pervasive as labor markets tightened. Moreover, employers were continuing their efforts to attract or retain workers that were in particularly scarce supply by means of a variety of bonus payments and other incentives that were not included in standard measures of labor compensation. There also were reports of offers of expanded benefits and, in some instances, the granting of very large wage increases to highly skilled technical personnel. ']
