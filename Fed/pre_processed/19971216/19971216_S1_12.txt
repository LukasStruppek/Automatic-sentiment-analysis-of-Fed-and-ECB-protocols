[' At its meeting on November 12, 1997, the Committee had adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate averaging around 5-1/2 percent. In the directive the Committee had retained a tilt toward a possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Such a bias had been seen as consistent with the members views that the risks continued to be skewed toward rising inflation and that the next policy move was more likely to be in the direction of some firming than toward easing. Reserve market conditions associated with this directive had been expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months. Open market operations throughout the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with the intended average of around 5-1/2 percent for the federal funds rate, and the average effective rate over the period was close to that rate level. In other domestic financial markets, short-term interest rates registered small mixed changes since the day before the Committee meeting on November 12, 1997, while bond yields fell somewhat. Share prices in U.S. equity markets recorded mixed changes over the period. Domestic financial markets became somewhat less volatile over the period, though further turmoil in a number of foreign markets fostered a sense of unease that was reflected in relatively wide yield spreads and, on occasion, in trading activity and price movements. Equity markets in other countries, notably in Asia, remained volatile. ']
