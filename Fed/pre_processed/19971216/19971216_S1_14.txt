[" Growth in the broad monetary aggregates picked up to relatively rapid rates in November. Strength in currency and a surge in liquid deposits boosted the expansion of M2, while that of M3 was amplified by a step-up in RP borrowing to help finance more rapid growth in bank credit. For the year through November, M2 expanded at a rate that was slightly above the upper bound of the Committee's annual range, and M3 at a rate substantially above the upper bound of its range. The increase in total domestic nonfinancial debt for the year to date was at a pace somewhat below the middle of the Committee's range. "]
