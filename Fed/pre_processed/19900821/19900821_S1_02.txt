Short-term interest rates have fallen somewhat since the Committee meeting on July 2-3, while rates in bond markets have risen appreciably, as oil prices have increased. The trade-weighted foreign exchange G-10 value of the dollar in terms of the other currencies declined considerably over the intermeeting period. M2 grew slowly in June and July, while M3 was little changed; available data for August suggest a partial rebound in both aggregates. Growth of M2 and especially of M3 has been damped by the continuing contraction of deposits at thrift institutions resulting from the restructuring of the thrift industry. Through July, expansion of both M2 and M3 was estimated to be in the lower portions of their respective ranges for 1990. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have been near the midpoint of its monitoring range.
