The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is continuing to expand at a relatively slow pace. After a sizable rise in May and June, total nonfarm payroll employment registered a large decline in July, much but not all of which reflected layoffs of temporary census workers. The civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.5 percent in July, just above the narrow range that had prevailed for an extended period. Industrial production was unchanged in July after rising appreciably in the second quarter. Retail sales rose considerably on balance over June and July after declines in earlier months. Available indicators point to a sluggish trend in business capital spending. Residential U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed sharply in June; for the second quarter, the trade deficit was substantially reduced from its first-quarter rate. Consumer prices rose appreciably further in June and July, while producer prices were about unchanged over the two months. The latest data on labor costs suggest no improvement in underlying trends. Crude oil prices have risen sharply over the last several weeks.
