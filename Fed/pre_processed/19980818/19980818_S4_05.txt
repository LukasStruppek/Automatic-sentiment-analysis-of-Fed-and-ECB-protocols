[' Mr. Jordan dissented because he believed that the underlying strength of aggregate demand in the U.S. economy would remain fundamentally intact, despite economic problems abroad. The problems in Asia provide a channel for economic imbalances to develop. Exports from some U.S. manufacturing industries will decline due to softer foreign markets and import competition. At the same time, domestic demand for imports, housing, and consumer durables will increase due to favorable interest rate trends. Though U.S. production of goods and services might slow during the period ahead, it is not yet clear that total demand will diminish at a comparable pace. At the same time, ample credit provision encourages speculative lending and excessive consumption. Consequently, continued rapid growth in the money supply creates the risk that inflation will accelerate and economic imbalances will become protracted. ']
