[' Among the factors bearing on the outlook for domestic economic activity, the members viewed the external sector as a major source of uncertainty. The continued rapid decline in net exports during the first half of the year largely seemed to reflect the further financial unsettlement and a deeper contraction in Asian economies than had been anticipated earlier, and several members commented that they saw little evidence that financial and economic conditions in Asia were stabilizing. Indeed, such conditions appeared to be worsening further in some Asian nations, and other countries had been affected by the associated weakening in the demand for commodities and the more risk-averse attitudes of investors. Anecdotal reports at this meeting suggested that the impact on the domestic economy was being felt by manufacturing firms in several industries, although some firms also reported that declining exports to Asia were being offset at least in part by rising exports to other areas of the world. Looking ahead, the members agreed that the duration and extent of disruptions in Asian and other economies could not be anticipated with any degree of confidence; while net exports were not expected to decline as rapidly as they had in the first half of the year, even more serious disruptions in Asia could not be ruled out and would have important implications for the U.S. economy.
