[" While overall economic conditions had not changed enough in recent weeks to warrant an adjustment in policy, a majority of the members agreed that the risks to the economic outlook were now more balanced and called for a shift from asymmetry to symmetry in the Committee's directive. Such a directive would better represent their view that the Committee's next policy move could be in either direction depending on developments abroad and their interaction with a domestic economy that had remained quite strong. Greater difficulties abroad and associated downward pressures on demand and prices had substantially diminished the chances of a strengthening of inflation pressures over coming months and quarters that would require a near-term tightening of policy. Other members continued to believe that the risks were still tilted to some degree toward rising inflation, though to a lesser extent than earlier. Labor market developments continued to suggest that the economy could well be producing beyond its sustainable potential and concrete signs that inflation pressures would abate had yet to emerge. Accordingly, they still preferred an asymmetrical directive but could accept symmetry in light of the prevailing uncertainties in the economic outlook and the expectation, shared by the other members, that policy would not need to be changed during the intermeeting period ahead.
