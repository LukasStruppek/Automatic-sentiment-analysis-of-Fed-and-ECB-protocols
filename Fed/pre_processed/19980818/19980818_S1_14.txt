[" In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar rose somewhat further over the intermeeting period in relation to other major currencies. The dollar changed little against the continental European currencies but it moved up strongly against the Japanese yen and, to a lesser extent, the Canadian dollar. The dollar's rise in terms of the yen reflected spreading pessimism regarding the Japanese government's ability to redress the problems of its troubled banking system and provide fiscal stimulus adequate to turn its economy around. The dollar's advance against the Canadian dollar occurred in the context of continuing weakness in global commodity prices that was weighing down that currency. The dollar also appreciated slightly in terms of an index of the currencies of the developing countries of Latin America and Asia that are important trading partners of the United States. "]
