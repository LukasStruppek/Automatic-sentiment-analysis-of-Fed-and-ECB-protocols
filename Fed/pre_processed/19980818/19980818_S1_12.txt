[' At its meeting on June 30-July 1, 1998, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that would be consistent with the federal funds rate continuing to average around 5-1/2 percent. With the balance of risks still pointing to the possibility of rising inflation over time, the Committee chose to retain an asymmetric directive tilted toward a possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds rate. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the months ahead. ']
