[' Total nominal retail sales fell in July after having risen at a rapid pace in the first half of the year. A sharp contraction in spending for motor vehicles, reflecting the termination at midyear of sales incentives offered by the Big Three automakers and shrinking inventories at GM dealers, more than accounted for the drop in July. Non-auto-related outlays continued on a robust upward trend, with gains evident in all major categories. Sales increases were particularly large at furniture and appliance stores and apparel outlets. In the housing sector, both demand and construction activity remained strong. Starts of single-family units edged down in May but rebounded in June. Sales of new homes were at an all-time high in June, and sales of existing homes were only a little below the record level reached in March of this year. With sales robust, the inventory of unsold new homes remained low. ']
