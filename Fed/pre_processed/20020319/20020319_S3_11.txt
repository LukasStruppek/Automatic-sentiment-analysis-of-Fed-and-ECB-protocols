The members generally viewed business fixed investment spending as the key to the strength of economic activity once the thrust from inventory restocking had run its course. The outlook for business capital expenditures would be governed to an important extent by business expectations regarding sales and profits. After the steep declines in business investment over the past year, anecdotal reports from around the country provided scattered indications of an upturn but no evidence at this point of any broad-based improvement. According to such reports and despite the strength of recent economic statistics, which had boosted the economic forecasts of many observers, business confidence remained at a low level, evidently reflecting a weak outlook for profits in the business community in the context of strong competitive pressures. Negative factors bearing on the outlook for investment in capital equipment included the persistence of large margins of excess capacity in many industries. The outlook for commercial and other nonresidential construction seemed even less promising, at least for the next several quarters, given high vacancy rates in commercial structures in many parts of the nation. Members nonetheless cited some positives in this outlook that included the favorable effects on incentives to purchase capital equipment stemming from the outlook for relatively rapid growth in productivity and the recent passage of legislation providing a temporary tax incentive for investments in equipment and software. On balance, a substantial pickup in overall capital spending seemed likely to be delayed in the absence of surprising strength in final demand, but a wide range of possible outcomes could not be ruled out for this key sector of the economy.
