By unanimous vote, the Committee approved a proposal to include the vote on monetary policy in the press statement released after every meeting, beginning with this meeting. In addition to identifying the voters, the press release would indicate the policy preferences of dissenters, if any. Such information could prove useful to market participants, who on occasion had employed indirect and frequently misleading information to gauge the Committee's vote before it was released as part of the minutes after the next meeting.
