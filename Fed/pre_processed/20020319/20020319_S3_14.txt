The members expected price pressures to remain relatively contained over the next several quarters in the context of what they anticipated would be only a gradual reduction of the excess capacity in labor and product markets as the recovery progressed. Moreover, the prospects of relatively robust growth in productivity in a highly flexible and competitive economy likely would moderate the extent of any potential buildup in inflationary pressures in the future. Members nonetheless mentioned some potential negatives in this outlook, notably the possibility of rising wage pressures as labor markets became more fully employed and upward price pressures stemming from increasing steel, energy, and insurance costs.
