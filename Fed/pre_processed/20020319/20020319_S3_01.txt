At its meeting on January 29-30, 2002, the Committee adopted a directive that called for implementing conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the intended level of the federal funds rate at 1-3/4 percent. The members noted that policy had been eased substantially over the past year and that the inflation-adjusted federal funds rate was at an unusually low level. As a result, policy was positioned to support an economic recovery as forces restraining aggregate demand abated. Nonetheless, the members agreed that there were factors that might keep the pace of expansion below the rate of growth of potential for a while, and thus the balance of risks continued to be tilted toward economic weakness in the foreseeable future.
