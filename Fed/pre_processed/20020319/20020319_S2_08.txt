The pace of liquidation of manufacturing and trade inventories, excluding motor vehicles, slowed in January after a very rapid rundown in the fourth quarter, and with sales higher the aggregate inventory-sales ratio declined to its lowest level since midyear 2000. Manufacturers' stocks were drawn down sharply further in January, and the sector's stock-to-shipments ratio fell appreciably. At the wholesale level, the rate of inventory runoff slowed somewhat, but the sector's inventory-sales ratio declined further. The level of inventories at the retail level increased somewhat despite a rise in sales, and the sector's aggregate inventory-sales ratio was at an historically low level.
