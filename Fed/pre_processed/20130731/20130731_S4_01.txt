 Committee members viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity expanded at a modest pace during the first half of the year Labor market conditions showed further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remained elevated Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector was strengthening, but mortgage rates had risen somewhat and fiscal policy was restraining economic growth The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth would pick up from its recent pace, resulting in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the Committee's dual mandate With economic activity and employment continuing to grow despite tighter fiscal policy, and with global financial conditions less strained overall, members generally continued to see the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since last fall Inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting transitory influences, but longer-run inflation expectations were stable, and the Committee anticipated that inflation would move back toward its 2 percent objective over the medium term Members recognized, however, that inflation persistently below the Committee's 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance
