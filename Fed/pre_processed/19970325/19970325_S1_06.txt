[' Private nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in January and February. The gains continued to be led by sizable advances in the services and trade industries. Employment in construction increased considerably over the two months, largely because of unseasonably warm weather across much of the country in February that led to an earlier-than-usual pickup in building activity. Aggregate hours of private production workers, which were also affected by changing weather conditions, were up appreciably on balance over the two months, and the average workweek increased considerably, reaching a new recent high in February. The civilian unemployment rate, at 5.3 percent in February, was unchanged from its average level in the second half of 1996. ']
