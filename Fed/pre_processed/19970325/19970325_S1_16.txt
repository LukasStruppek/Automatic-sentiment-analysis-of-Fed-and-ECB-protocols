[' Growth of M2 moderated somewhat in January and February from a brisk pace in late 1996, while expansion of M3 remained rapid in both months. Data for the first part of March suggested diminished growth of both aggregates.

M3 also continued to be boosted by the rapid growth of money market mutual funds. The expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have slowed in the early part of the year in conjunction with reduced borrowing by both federal and state governments, which were drawing down cash balances.
