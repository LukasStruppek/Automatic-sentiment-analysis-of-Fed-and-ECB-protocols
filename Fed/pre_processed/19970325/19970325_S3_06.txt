[" The outlook for fiscal policy remained one of modest restraint; on the basis of existing legislation, reductions were anticipated in constant-dollar purchases of goods and services by the federal government in fiscal years 1997 and 1998. A key element in the potential impact of fiscal policy was the uncertain outcome of the current effort to eliminate the federal deficit over time. Although success in that effort probably would have little effect on the government's budget position over the next few years, it likely would have some beneficial repercussions on business and consumer confidence and possibly also on financial markets. Financial markets would be especially positively affected by an agreement to reduce significantly the growth of entitlements, which would damp government spending and deficits over the longer run. "]
