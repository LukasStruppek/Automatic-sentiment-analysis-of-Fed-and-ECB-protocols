[" The Manager advised the Committee that he continued to anticipate a pattern of reserve needs that might require another unusually large addition to the System's outright holdings of U.S. government securities during the relatively long intermeeting period ahead. The limit on increases in outright holdings between meetings had been raised to $12 billion at the February meeting, and the Manager requested that the higher limit be retained for the upcoming period. By unanimous vote, the Committee amended paragraph 1(a) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations to raise the limit on intermeeting changes in such holdings from $8 billion to $12 billion for the period ending with the close of business on the date of the next meeting, May 20, 1997.
