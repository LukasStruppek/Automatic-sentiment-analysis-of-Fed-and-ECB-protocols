[' Consumer spending strengthened considerably further in early 1997 after registering a sizable increase over the fourth quarter. Nominal retail sales rose sharply in January and February. The gains over the two months were concentrated in sales of durable goods, including motor vehicles and building materials. Spending on services rose strongly in January (latest data) but may have moderated in February when milder-than-normal weather held down heating costs. Recent surveys indicated that consumer confidence had risen to the highest levels in many years. ']
