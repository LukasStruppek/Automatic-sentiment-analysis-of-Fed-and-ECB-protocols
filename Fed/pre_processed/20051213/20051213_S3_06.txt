In their discussion of prices, participants indicated that their concerns about near-term inflation pressures had eased somewhat over the intermeeting period. Recent data suggested that, thus far, indirect effects of elevated energy prices on core inflation had been muted. Moreover, energy prices generally had fallen back on balance since earlier in the fall, and much of the increases in inflation expectations posted in the aftermath of the hurricanes had reversed. Participants noted that robust competition--including that from foreign producers--and further substantial gains in productivity were helping to contain cost and price pressures. Moreover, measures of labor compensation showed only moderate gains while relatively wide profit margins could allow firms to absorb somewhat larger increases in labor and other costs without boosting prices. Nonetheless, surveys and anecdotal reports suggested that some firms were successfully passing at least a portion of their increased costs on to customers, and many participants remained concerned that elevated energy prices could put pressure on core inflation. Also, in the view of a number of participants, the economy was possibly producing in the neighborhood of its potential, and the persistent strength in spending of late suggested that resource markets could tighten further and inflation pressures build. Under these circumstances, and with policy having been accommodative for some time, inflation expectations could rise if monetary policy were not seen as responding to contain such risks.
