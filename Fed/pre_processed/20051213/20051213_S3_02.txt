In their discussion of major sectors of the economy, meeting participants noted that, while light vehicle sales had slowed in the fall, consumer spending outside the auto sector appeared to have remained vigorous. Holiday sales were said to be off to a good start in many parts of the country. The substantial recovery in measures of consumer confidence after their sharp declines in the aftermath of the hurricanes had reduced meeting participants' concerns about a significant pull-back in spending. Going forward, consumer outlays were expected to be supported by further advances in employment and income.
