The U.S. international trade deficit reached a new record in September. A surge in imports was accompanied by a fairly sizable drop in exports, part of which was due to a steep falloff in aircraft exports as a result of the strike at Boeing. The jump in the value of imports was driven by strong growth in most categories of goods and, to a lesser extent, growth in services; increases in the dollar value of imports of oil and of industrial supplies--especially natural gas--were particularly strong, a reflection of higher prices. Foreign industrialized economies expanded robustly in the third quarter, and available indicators for the fourth quarter appeared promising, on balance.
