At its November meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4 percent. In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. The Committee also noted that elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions in economic activity had temporarily depressed output and employment. However, monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, was providing ongoing support to economic activity. And although the cumulative rise in energy and other costs had the potential to add to inflation pressures, core inflation had been relatively low in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations remained contained. In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely to be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.
