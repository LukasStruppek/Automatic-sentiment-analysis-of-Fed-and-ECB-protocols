The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth of economic activity would slow from this year's pace, but remain solid, with output staying near the economy's potential over the next two years. Although hurricane-related rebuilding would boost activity, especially in the near term, this stimulus increasingly would be countered by higher interest rates, the anticipated waning of the positive wealth effect associated with large earlier gains in equity and house prices, and reduced impetus from fiscal policy. Both overall and core consumer price inflation were projected to move higher in the first half of next year, reflecting the effects of higher energy prices, but then to trend lower as those effects ebb.
