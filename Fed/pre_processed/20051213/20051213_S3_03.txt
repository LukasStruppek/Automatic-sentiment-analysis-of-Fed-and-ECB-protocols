Meeting participants discussed tentative signs that activity was beginning to slow in the housing sector. Reports from contacts in many parts of the country suggested somewhat less ebullient market conditions, and measures of confidence of homebuyers and builders had fallen back noticeably. A downshift in attitudes regarding the outlook for the housing sector could have significant market effects, in part by damping the demand for houses by investors and speculators. A slowing of house price increases, by restraining the expansion of consumption, and a moderation in the pace of new building were expected to reduce the growth of aggregate demand somewhat in coming quarters. To date, however, the national data on home prices, sales, and construction activity did not suggest a significant weakening in the sector.
