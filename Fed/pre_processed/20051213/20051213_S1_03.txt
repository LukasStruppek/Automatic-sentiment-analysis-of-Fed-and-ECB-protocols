Private nonfarm payrolls grew rapidly in November after a small gain in October. Construction employment posted another large increase, probably owing in part to hurricane-related activity. Broad-based gains in durable goods industries augmented manufacturing employment, and employment in the related industries of temporary help services and wholesale trade increased as well. With employment rising but the average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers falling slightly, aggregate hours slipped in November--albeit to a level above that of their third-quarter average. The unemployment rate held steady at 5 percent, and the labor force participation rate was also unchanged. Survey measures of individuals' expectations of future labor market conditions improved in November, largely reversing post-Katrina declines.
