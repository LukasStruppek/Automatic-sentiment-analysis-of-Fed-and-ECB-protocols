Industrial production rebounded in October after having been held down in September by hurricanes and by a strike at Boeing. The resumption of commercial aircraft production boosted manufacturing output and more than offset a fall in the production of motor vehicles and parts. Large output gains in hurricane-affected industries--such as segments of the food, rubber and plastics, and paper industries--also contributed to the increase in manufacturing output. The growth of high-tech output slowed slightly in October, mainly as a result of smaller increases in the production of semiconductors. In contrast, production of communication equipment--particularly data networking equipment--accelerated. With many energy facilities in the Gulf region still closed, output at mines, which is defined to include oil and gas extraction, slipped further in October. Manufacturing capacity utilization moved up again in October and was only a touch below its long-run average.
