Real personal consumption expenditures appeared to be increasing solidly over the course of the fourth quarter, led by improvements in the fundamental determinants of consumer spending. Real disposable personal income was bolstered by gains in employment and falling retail energy prices, while continued brisk advances in house prices and the recent strengthening of equity prices contributed importantly to increases in household wealth. Consumer sentiment picked up in November and early December; some survey measures of confidence returned to the range seen during the first half of the year. The personal saving rate--while still slightly negative--moved up in October.
