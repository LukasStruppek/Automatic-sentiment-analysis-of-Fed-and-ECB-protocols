[' The residential housing sector continued to surge, as single- family housing starts registered another strong advance in November and sales of new homes remained at a very high level. Unseasonably favorable weather over much of the country evidently contributed to that performance. Nonetheless, the low level of mortgage rates and a record high in an index of consumer assessments of homebuying conditions in November suggested that strength in single-family housing might continue for a time. Multifamily housing starts in October and November were slightly above the average for earlier in the year, and permits for new projects had been rising recently. ']
