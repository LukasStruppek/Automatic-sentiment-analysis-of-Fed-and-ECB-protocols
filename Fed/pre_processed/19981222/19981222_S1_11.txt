[' Business inventory accumulation slowed appreciably in October after a sizable rise in the third quarter. In manufacturing, however, the pace of stockbuilding picked up in October from a slow rate in the third quarter, and the stock-shipments ratio remained in the upper portion of its narrow range over the past year. In the wholesale sector, inventories declined somewhat in October following a large increase in the third quarter; much of the reduction was in farm products. The inventory-sales ratio for the wholesale sector was still at the top of its range over the past year. Retail inventory accumulation in October was near the modest pace of the third quarter, and the inventory-sales ratio was slightly below its range over the preceding twelve months. ']
