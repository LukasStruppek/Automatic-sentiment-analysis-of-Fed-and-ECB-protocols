[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that moderate growth at a pace close to the economy's potential remained a reasonable expectation for the year ahead. The members recognized, however, that such a projection was subject to an unusually wide range of uncertainty in both directions. On the upside, they emphasized the marked resilience and persisting strength of private domestic demand, which had kept the economy expanding at a faster pace than most had anticipated. In addition, members commented that domestic financial conditions, including the rebound in stock market prices, currently were supportive of further expansion in aggregate demand, and in that regard several noted the continued rapid growth of the broad monetary aggregates. Still, domestic financial markets remained unusually sensitive and subject to relatively pronounced adjustments to unanticipated developments that could have substantial effects on confidence and economic activity. The external sector continued to represent a major source of downside risk; the economies of several industrial countries seemed to be weakening, and the outlook for several key emerging market economies remained in doubt, with a further loss of confidence and contagion from the latter a continuing threat. With regard to the outlook for inflation, members reported that labor markets were extraordinarily tight across the nation, but they saw only limited evidence of accelerating wage increases and little or no evidence of rising inflation in broad measures of prices. Several commented, however, that the risks of inflation appeared to be tilted to the upside, given the continuing strength of the domestic expansion and accommodative financial conditions. "]
