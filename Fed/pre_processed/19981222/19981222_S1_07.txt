[' Total industrial production declined somewhat in November in association with a weather-related drop in utilities output and persisting weakness in mining activity. Manufacturing output was unchanged in November after a considerable increase in October. Production in high-tech industries recorded large gains over the October-November period, the output of construction supplies climbed rapidly, and consumer goods manufacture expanded briskly. Elsewhere, production of motor vehicles and parts was unchanged on balance over the two months and materials output continued to decline, with the iron and steel industry registering particularly large decreases. The utilization of manufacturing capacity dropped over the October- November period to its lowest level in more than five years. ']
