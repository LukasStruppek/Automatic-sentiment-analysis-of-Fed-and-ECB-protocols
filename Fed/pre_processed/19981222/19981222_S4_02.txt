[' As already noted, Committee members saw risks on both sides of their forecasts. Persistently strong demand and increasingly supportive conditions in debt and equity markets suggested the possibility of rising inflation pressures. But greater disturbances abroad, especially if they were to be transmitted to domestic financial markets, could exert considerable restraint on the domestic economy. Fortunately, with low inflation, if not price stability, increasingly embedded in expectations, the Committee would have time to react to potential inflationary pressures. In the event of downward shocks to the expansion, prompt action to ease policy would be needed, but such shocks could not be anticipated at this point. Against this background, all the members indicated that they were in favor of retaining the symmetry in the existing directive. ']
