[" In the Committee's discussion of the ranges for 1994, which tended to focus on M2, all the members expressed a preference for affirming the M2 and M3 ranges that had been established on a provisional basis in July and all but one favored adopting the provisional monitoring range for nonfinancial debt, that member preferred a lower range. Many of the members commented on the uncertainties that surrounded the establishment of ranges that were consistent with the Committee's goals for the economy. They noted that a variety of developments had altered the historical relationships between the monetary aggregates and broad measures of economic performance over the past several years. The resulting uncertainty implied that the Committee needed to retain a flexible approach to the behavior of the monetary aggregates in relation to their ranges, including the need to assess a broad array of other indicators to gauge the implications of monetary growth developments. Nonetheless, the members concluded that as best they could evaluate evolving financial conditions at this point, monetary growth within the tentative ranges would be likely to promote the Committee's objectives of sustained economic expansion and subdued inflation.
