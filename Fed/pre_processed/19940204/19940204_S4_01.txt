[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, the members favored an adjustment toward a less accommodative policy stance, though views differed to some extent with regard to the amount of the adjustment. The current policy posture, which had been in effect since the late summer of 1992, was highly stimulative as evidenced, for example, by very low or even slightly negative real short-term interest rates and, in the view of at least some members, the relatively rapid growth over an extended period in narrow measures of money and reserves. Such a policy had been appropriate in a period when various developments had tended to inhibit the expansion, including widespread efforts to repair strained balance sheets and a variety of business restructuring activities that had tended to depress confidence and spending. More recently, the considerable progress made by households and businesses in decreasing their debt service burdens and the much strengthened capital positions of lending institutions had provided a financial basis, in the context of low interest rates, for growth in demands on productive capacity that could generate inflation pressures. In this situation, the members agreed that monetary policy should be adjusted toward a more neutral stance that would encourage sustained economic growth without a buildup of inflationary imbalances. The members recognized that timely action was needed to preclude the necessity for more vigorous and disruptive policy moves later if inflationary pressures were allowed to intensify. The history of past cyclical upswings had demonstrated the inflationary consequences and adverse effects on economic activity of delayed anti-inflation policy actions. "]
