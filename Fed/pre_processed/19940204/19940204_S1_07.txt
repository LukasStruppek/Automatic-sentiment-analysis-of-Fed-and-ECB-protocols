[' At its meeting on February 2-3, 1993, the Committee had reaffirmed the $5 billion limit on the amount of eligible foreign currencies that the System was prepared to "warehouse" for the Treasury and the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The purpose of the warehousing facility is to supplement, at the discretion of the Federal Reserve, the U.S. dollar resources of the Treasury and the ESF for financing their purchases of foreign currencies and related international operations. There had been no use of this facility since a ESF repayment of $2 billion on April 2, 1992. The Committee decided at this meeting to reaffirm the $5 billion ceiling which it viewed as providing adequate operational flexibility to respond on short notice to unanticipated developments. ']
