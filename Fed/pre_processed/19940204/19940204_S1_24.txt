[" Growth of the broad monetary aggregates, though a little faster than in most of 1993, remained relatively slow over December and January. Investors evidently continued to find low-yielding deposits less appealing than stock and bond mutual funds, although recent inflows to bond funds appeared to have been at a slower rate than that seen over most of 1993. For the year 1993, growth of both M2 and M3 was estimated to have been slightly above the lower ends of the Committee's ranges. Private borrowing had picked up in recent months, and total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a somewhat faster, though still moderate, pace in the fourth quarter; for the year, nonfinancial debt was estimated to have been in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.
