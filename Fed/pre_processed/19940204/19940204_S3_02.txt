[' In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt aggregates, the Committee members and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had prepared projections of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and inflation for 1994. The central tendency of the forecasts pointed to somewhat faster economic growth this year than currently was estimated for 1993. The anticipated rate of economic expansion was expected to foster a limited further drop in the rate of unemployment by the fourth quarter of this year. With the slack in productive resources expected to diminish further to a quite low level, price and cost pressures were unlikely to abate significantly: indeed, price increases in 1994 could exceed those of 1993 when inflation had been held down by favorable developments in energy prices. Measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994, the forecasts for growth of real GDP had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/4 percent and a full range of 2-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent. Projections of the civilian rate of unemployment in the fourth quarter of 1994 were all in a range of 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent calculated on the basis of the new survey recently introduced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For the CPI, the central tendency of the forecasts for the period from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994 was centered on increases of about 3 percent within a range of 2-1/4 to 4 percent, and for nominal GDP the forecasts were clustered in a range of 5-1/2 to 6 percent for the year.
