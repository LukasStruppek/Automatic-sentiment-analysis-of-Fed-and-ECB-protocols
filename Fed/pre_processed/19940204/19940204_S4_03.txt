[' Other members indicated a preference for a somewhat greater firming action that would move monetary policy closer to a desirable neutral stance. In this view, recent developments in the economy had demonstrated that monetary policy was much too accommodative and that slow, gradual tightening moves risked allowing inflation pressures to build. A more decisive policy move at this juncture would in fact reduce uncertainty, because fewer discrete actions would be required and they would have a more pronounced and desirable effect in curbing inflationary sentiment and thus in minimizing upward pressures on longer-term interest rates over time. The result would be a policy stance that was more consistent with sustained economic expansion and progress toward price stability. ']
