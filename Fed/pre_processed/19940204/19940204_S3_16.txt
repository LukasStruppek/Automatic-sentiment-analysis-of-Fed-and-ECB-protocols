[" With regard to the range for nonfinancial debt, the members anticipated that its growth this year would remain within the contemplated range. A staff analysis suggested that its federal borrowing component would decrease as a result of the ongoing effects of deficit reduction measures that had been enacted and the rise in tax receipts stemming from economic growth. At the same time, borrowing by the nonfederal sectors should strengthen further against the backdrop of more comfortable financial positions and the expected pickup in GDP expansion. In one view, however, a somewhat lower range was desirable for nonfinancial debt. In light of the shift in business preferences away from debt and toward equity, debt velocity could increase and slower growth in debt would be consistent with the Committee's objectives. However, this member could accept the higher range favored by the other members for 1994. "]
