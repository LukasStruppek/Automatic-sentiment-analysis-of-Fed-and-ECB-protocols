[' Consumer spending, as measured by real personal consumption expenditures, posted another solid increase in the fourth quarter, and strong sales of motor vehicles in January suggested continued buoyancy in consumer demand. In the fourth quarter, real outlays on motor vehicles surged, and spending on other durable goods--notably furniture, appliances and other household equipment--registered further large gains. By contrast, real outlays for nondurable goods and services rose only moderately. Housing starts jumped in December, with both single-family and multifamily starts sharing in the advance. For 1993 as a whole, housing starts were at their highest annual total in four years. Sales of new homes were up sharply in November, and sales of existing homes ended the year at the highest monthly level in the twenty-five year history of the series. ']
