[" In the Committee's review of factors underlying recent developments, members observed that generally favorable financial conditions provided a backdrop conducive to further robust expansion in business activity. Much of the recent strengthening in economic growth was generated by increased spending in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing in response to relatively low interest rates. Generally buoyant equity markets, a readier availability of financing from lending institutions, and the strengthened financial condition of businesses and households also were cited as factors tending to boost economic activity. Balance sheet restructuring activities appeared to have slackened markedly, and while balance sheet adjustments probably were still being made, the latter seemed to be exerting much less restraint on the willingness of businesses and especially households to spend and to incur new debt to finance growing expenditures.
