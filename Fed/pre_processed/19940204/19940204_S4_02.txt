[" In the course of the Committee's discussion, a number of members endorsed a policy move that would involve only a slight adjustment toward a less accommodative degree of reserve pressure. These members recognized that evolving economic conditions might well justify a somewhat greater policy adjustment. They believed, however, that even a slight move at this time was likely to have a particularly strong impact on financial markets because it would be the first policy change after a long hiatus and indeed the first tightening action in about five years. The market effect might be amplified by a contemplated decision to authorize the Chairman to announce the policy action (discussed below). In the circumstances, these members felt that a somewhat greater policy adjustment would incur an unacceptable risk of dislocative repercussions in financial markets. A relatively small move would readily accomplish the purposes of signaling the Committee's anti-inflation resolve and together with expected further action should help to temper or avert an increase in inflation expectations and speculative developments in financial markets.
