[" In 1993, both M2 and M3 had grown at rates about 1/2 percentage point above the lower bounds of the ranges that the Committee now contemplated retaining for 1994. According to a staff analysis prepared for this meeting, somewhat faster growth in both of these aggregates could be expected in 1994. But with nominal GDP also expected to be stronger, as indicated by the central tendency of the members' forecasts, the velocity of M2 would continue to rise at an appreciably faster rate than historical relationships would have suggested. This assessment assumed that households would continue to redirect savings from M2-type accounts to higher-yielding investments, especially bond and stock mutual funds. However, such redeployments of funds should moderate this year to the extent that some investors already had accomplished a considerable portion of their desired portfolio reallocations and in light of the possibility that changes in the prices of stocks and bonds, including the drop in bond prices in recent months, would underline the risks of holding such instruments. Moreover, depository institutions had strengthened their capital positions markedly and were likely to compete more aggressively for M2 and especially for M3-type deposits in an effort to maintain or increase their role in the financing of expanding economic activity. While these developments and their implications for monetary growth could not be forecast with confidence, the members believed that the ranges under consideration would probably be sufficiently wide to accommodate M2 and M3 growth rates under a variety of likely velocity scenarios. For example, if the factors that had tended to depress the growth of the broad aggregates in relation to income did not abate as expected this year, M2 and M3 growth would again be near the lower bounds of the Committee's ranges. Alternatively, if the behavior of these aggregates were to move closer to earlier patterns, growth in the upper portions of the ranges would foster an economic performance in line with the members' forecasts.
