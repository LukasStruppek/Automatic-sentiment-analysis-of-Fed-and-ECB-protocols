[' One sector of the economy that was viewed as a source of particular uncertainty was the outlook for inventories. Business firms continued to maintain tight control over their inventories, and in general the latter were at quite low levels in relation to sales. Indeed, there were some anecdotal reports that inventory shortfalls had resulted in the loss of sales in recent months. Lean inventory levels in the context of diminishing slack in labor and product markets raised concerns about the potential for increasing capacity pressures should strong demands persist that would tend to deplete existing inventories and lead to efforts not only to rebuild but to increase them. Thus far, there were few signs of developments such as significant increases in delivery lead times or in the costs of goods purchased by business firms that in the past had triggered substantial inventory buildups. However, there were ample precedents in the history of business cycle expansions of efforts to accumulate large inventories in periods when strong final demands already were exerting inflationary pressures in the economy.
