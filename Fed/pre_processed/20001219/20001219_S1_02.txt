The information reviewed at this meeting provided evidence that economic activity, which had expanded at an appreciably lower pace since midyear, might have slowed further in recent months. Consumer spending and business purchases of equipment and software had decelerated markedly after having registered extraordinary gains in the first half of the year. Housing construction, though still relatively firm, was noticeably below its robust pace of earlier in the year. With final spending rising at a reduced rate, inventory overhangs had emerged in a number of goods-producing industries, most visibly in the motor vehicle sector. Manufacturing production had declined as a consequence, and the rate of expansion in employment had moderated further. Evidence on core price inflation was mixed; by one measure, it appeared to be increasing very gradually, in part reflecting the indirect effects of higher energy costs, but by another it had remained at a relatively subdued level.
