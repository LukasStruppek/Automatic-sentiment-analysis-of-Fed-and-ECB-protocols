Consumer spending appeared to be decelerating noticeably further in the fourth quarter in an environment of diminished consumer confidence, smaller job gains, and lower stock prices. Retail sales were down somewhat on balance in October and November after a substantial third-quarter increase; sales of light vehicles dropped over the two months, and growth in expenditures on other consumer goods slowed. Outlays on services continued to grow at a moderate rate through October (latest data).
