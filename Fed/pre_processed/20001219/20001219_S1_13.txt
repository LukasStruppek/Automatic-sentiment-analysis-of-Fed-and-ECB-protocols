In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar edged lower on balance over the intermeeting interval in terms of the currencies of a broad group of U.S. trading partners. Among the major foreign currencies, the dollar fell moderately against the euro but moved up to a roughly comparable extent in terms of the yen. The dollar's decline against the euro reflected a growing perception that economic expansion in the euro area would cool comparatively less than in the United States. Correspondingly, the slide of the yen seemed to be related to weak economic data, stagnant business sentiment, and political uncertainties in Japan. The dollar posted a small gain against an index of the currencies of other important trading partners, largely reflecting weaker financial conditions in some emerging economies.
