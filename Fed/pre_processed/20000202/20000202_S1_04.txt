The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had expanded rapidly in recent months. Consumer spending had remained very brisk, business fixed investment had continued on a strong upward trend, and housing demand was still at a relatively high level despite some slippage recently. The growth of domestic demand had been met in part through further advances in imports. Domestically, industrial production and nonfarm payrolls had continued to increase briskly. Despite very tight labor markets, labor costs had been climbing more slowly than in 1998. Consumer price inflation had stayed moderate over the past few months, despite a recent resurgence in energy prices.
