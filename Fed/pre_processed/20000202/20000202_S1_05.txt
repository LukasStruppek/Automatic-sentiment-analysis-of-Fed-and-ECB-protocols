Labor demand remained robust through year-end, as nonfarm payroll employment posted a further large increase in December. Job growth in the services industry was brisk, construction hiring rose somewhat further against a backdrop of good weather and project backlogs, and manufacturing employment was essentially unchanged. The civilian unemployment rate held at 4.1 percent in December, its low for the year, and initial claims for unemployment insurance persisted at a very low level through late January.
