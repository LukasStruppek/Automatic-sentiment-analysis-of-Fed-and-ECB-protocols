 Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that growth in economic activity had picked up in recent quarters Labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement The unemployment rate had declined but remained elevated when judged against members' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment Household spending and business fixed investment had advanced more quickly in recent months than earlier in 2013, while the recovery in the housing sector had slowed somewhat Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, although the extent of the restraint had diminished The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, the economy would expand at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate would gradually decline toward levels consistent with the dual mandate Moreover, members continued to judge that the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market had become more nearly balanced Inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective, and this was seen as posing possible risks to economic performance, but members anticipated that stable inflation expectations and strengthening economic activity would, over time, return inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective However, in light of their concerns about the persistence of low inflation, many members saw a need for the Committee to monitor inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation was moving back toward its longer-run objective
