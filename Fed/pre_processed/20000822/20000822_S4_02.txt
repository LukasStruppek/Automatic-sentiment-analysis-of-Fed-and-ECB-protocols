At the same time, many members emphasized that the Committee needed to be prepared to act promptly should inflationary pressures appear to be intensifying, and in the Committee's discussion of the balance-of-risks sentence to be included in the press statement that would be issued after this meeting, all the members agreed that the sentence should continue to indicate that the risks to the economy remained weighted toward higher inflation in the foreseeable future. While the members did not expect underlying inflation to intensify materially, especially over the nearer term, the statement was intended to express their views about the longer term, and over that horizon they agreed that the risks lay in the direction of price acceleration. The risks of higher inflation over time were seen importantly to stem from the unusually taut conditions in labor markets, which could place upward pressures on unit costs and prices, especially once productivity growth leveled out in the future. But members also cited the potential for persistently higher energy prices to affect longer-run inflation expectations, and the possibility that, taking into consideration recent declines in long-term interest rates, financial conditions might not yet be tight enough to balance aggregate demand and potential supply in the face of optimism about the growth of labor and capital income in association with accelerating productivity.
