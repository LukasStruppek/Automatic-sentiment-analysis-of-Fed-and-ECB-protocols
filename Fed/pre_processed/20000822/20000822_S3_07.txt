The strengthening economies of many U.S. trading partners were fostering rising demand for U.S. exports, a trend that seemed likely to persist according to reports from many domestic business contacts. Nonetheless, the nation's current account deficit apparently continued to increase, a development about which members expressed concern in view of the risks that it posed for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and domestic inflation over time. Still, the experience of the last few years clearly demonstrated that the dollar was likely to remain strong as long as foreign investors continued to see attractive investment opportunities in the United States. Past experience also suggested that international capital flows can quickly reverse themselves, but the timing of a major turnaround in the dollar, if any, could not be predicted with any degree of confidence.
