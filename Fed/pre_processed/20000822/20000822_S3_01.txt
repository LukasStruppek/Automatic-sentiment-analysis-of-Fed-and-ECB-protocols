In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, the members agreed that the information available since midyear provided increased evidence that the growth of aggregate demand and that of aggregate supply were coming into closer balance. The statistical evidence reviewed by the Committee, which was supported by widespread anecdotal reports, pointed to a noticeable slowing in the expansion of demand and economic activity. The slowdown was led by a moderation in consumer spending and some decline in housing expenditures that were occurring even before the full effects of earlier tightening in financial conditions had been felt. At the same time, an apparent continued acceleration in underlying productivity was boosting the economy's potential output growth and, in the context of the leveling out of the broadest measures of equity prices this year, was doing so without the full feedback on demand of previous such accelerations. While prices were rising somewhat more than a year ago, most of this pickup seemed to reflect the direct and indirect effects of higher energy prices, and the increase in productivity growth had kept unit labor costs well contained despite more rapid gains in compensation. These developments had much improved the prospects for a sustainable economic expansion at the prevailing stance of monetary policy. Even so, the members anticipated that labor markets would remain exceptionally tight, and with labor compensation already accelerating and higher energy prices potentially raising inflation expectations, they agreed that the risks remained weighted toward rising inflation.
