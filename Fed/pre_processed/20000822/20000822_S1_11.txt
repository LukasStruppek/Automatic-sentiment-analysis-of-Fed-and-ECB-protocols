Recent data suggested that price inflation had picked up slightly. Consumer prices, as measured in the CPI, jumped in June in response to a surge in energy prices but climbed only modestly further in July when energy prices changed little. Excluding the food and energy components, consumer prices rose moderately in both months. For the twelve months ended in July, core CPI prices increased somewhat more than in the previous twelve-month period. When measured by the PCE chain-price index, however, the acceleration in core consumer prices during the last four quarters was very small. Producer prices exhibited a pattern that was generally similar to that of consumer prices. Prices of all finished goods jumped in June and were unchanged in July, and core producer prices were unchanged on balance in the June-July period. For the twelve months ended in July, core producer prices rose slightly more than in the previous twelve-month period. With regard to labor compensation, recent data suggested an acceleration, on balance, over the past year. Growth in hourly compensation for private industry workers slowed somewhat in the second quarter after having risen sharply in the first quarter. Over the four quarters ended in June, however, the change in compensation rates was substantially larger than the change over the previous four-quarter period. By contrast, the advance of average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers for the twelve months ended in July was about the same as that for the previous twelve-month period.
