The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services changed little in June from its May level, but the deficit for the second quarter as a whole was appreciably larger than its average for the first quarter. Both exports and imports grew rapidly last quarter, though the dollar value of imports increased significantly more than the value of exports. The available information indicated that economic expansion was vigorous in both foreign industrial countries and major developing countries in the second quarter, but recent information pointed to some slowing of growth in these countries.
