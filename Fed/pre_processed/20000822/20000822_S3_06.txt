In sharp contrast to developments in the consumer and housing sectors, business outlays for capital equipment and software had continued to rise at exceptional rates, even after several years of rapid growth. The persistence of dramatic expansion evidently reflected expectations that such capital investments would continue to earn very high rates of return. Although the extraordinary rates of increase in investment outlays currently displayed little or no sign of abating, historical patterns indicated that even dramatic surges or shifts in technology invariably lost momentum once the new technology was widely adopted, and rates of return on further investments tended to diminish. There was no reliable way to anticipate the timing of such a downturn and indeed little reason to expect a turnaround over the nearer term in the current investment boom. Members noted, however, that the investment outlook for the nonresidential construction sector presented a much more mixed picture. While such business investment continued to exhibit considerable vigor in many areas, it clearly had weakened in others and for the nation as a whole seemed poised for a relatively subdued advance in coming quarters. One factor pointing in the latter direction was evidence of more cautious attitudes on the part of many business executives and especially their lending institutions.
