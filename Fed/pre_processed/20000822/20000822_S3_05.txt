The housing sector provided the clearest indication of a response of aggregate demand to firming interest rates, affecting industries producing construction materials and household furnishings. Anecdotal reports from much of the country tended to confirm the statistical evidence of a downward trend in housing starts and home sales. Factors helping to explain the softness in housing, which included the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates and reported overbuilding in some metropolitan areas, were expected to continue to exert some downward pressure on housing activity. However, reference also was made to indications that wealth effects were continuing to boost housing demand and prices in parts of the country.
