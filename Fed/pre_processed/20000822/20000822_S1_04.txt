Total nonfarm payroll employment dropped appreciably in July after a small increase in June. Much of the weakness over the two months reflected substantial declines in the number of temporary Census workers. In the private sector, payroll gains had diminished somewhat on balance since the first quarter. The slowdown was particularly large in the usually robust services sector. Manufacturing employment, by contrast, had risen on net since the early spring after a lengthy decline. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 4.0 percent in July.
