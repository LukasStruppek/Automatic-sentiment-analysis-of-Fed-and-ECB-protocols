Staff Economic Outlook. In the forecast prepared for the September FOMC meeting, the staff raised its projection for real GDP growth over the second half of 2009 and over 2010. The information received during the intermeeting period appeared to indicate a more noticeable upturn than anticipated at the time of the August meeting: Sales and starts of single-family homes provided evidence of some firming in housing activity, capital spending indicators pointed to an earlier-than-anticipated trough for investment in E&S, and some data suggested a modest recovery in consumer spending. These tentative signs of a recovery of economic activity were supported by other factors, including recent rises in house and equity prices that would support household net worth, declines in interest rates on corporate bonds and fixed-rate mortgages, and a stronger outlook for activity in foreign economies. The staff expected that these positive factors would lead to a modest increase in final sales in the second half of 2009, despite continued weakness in commercial construction and some further deterioration in labor markets. As a result of the expected increase in final sales and an anticipated reduction in inventory liquidation, the staff projected that real GDP would increase in the second half of 2009 at a rate somewhat above the growth rate of potential output. For 2010, the staff forecast that output growth would continue to strengthen, supported by an ongoing improvement in financial conditions, a fading of the drag from earlier declines in income and wealth, accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, and recovery in the housing sector. These factors also contributed to an expected further increase in real GDP growth in 2011, despite an anticipated decline in the impetus from fiscal policy. Even though the upward revision to the projection for output was expected to generate larger gains in employment than previously forecast, the staff still projected only a slow improvement in labor markets, with the unemployment rate moving down to about 9 1/4 percent by the end of 2010 and then falling to about 8 percent by the end of 2011.
