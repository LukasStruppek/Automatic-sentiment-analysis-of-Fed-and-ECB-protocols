[" The Committee will continue its practice of announcing each change in the stance of monetary policy in a press release on the day the decision is made. This practice removes any uncertainty about the Committee's intentions in regard to reserve conditions and enables all financial market participants and others to receive the information at the same time. When no change is made at a meeting, the Committee normally will announce only the time when the meeting ended and that there are no further announcements. However, in some infrequent circumstances, the Committee may decide to issue a statement even when no change in policy is made. "]
