[' In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had prepared individual projections of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and inflation for the year 1995. Measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, their forecasts of the growth in real GDP had a central tendency of 2 to 3 percent, compared with a growth rate of 4 percent estimated for 1994. Most of the members also anticipated that economic expansion in line with their forecasts would be associated with little change in the unemployment rate and their projections of the rate in the fourth quarter of 1995 were centered in a narrow range around 5-1/2 percent. The high levels of resource utilization implied by these projections were viewed by most members as likely to foster somewhat greater pressure on wages and prices. Accordingly, projections of the rate of inflation, as indexed by the consumer price index, had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/2 percent for the period from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, compared with rates of about 2-3/4 percent in both 1993 and 1994.
