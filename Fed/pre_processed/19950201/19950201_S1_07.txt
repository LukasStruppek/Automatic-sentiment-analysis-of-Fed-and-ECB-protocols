[' Retail sales were reported to have changed little over November and December after substantial advances in September and October; the flattening of sales reflected sharply reduced increases in outlays for non-auto consumer goods. Consumer spending on services rose moderately on balance over November and December, with outlays for energy services held down by unusually mild weather. Although some indicators of housing demand had weakened, housing starts posted sizable gains on balance over November and December; single-family construction remained at a relatively high level despite the rise in mortgage rates in 1994, and multifamily construction continued its gradual recovery from the depressed levels of early 1993. The regional pattern of starts activity suggested that favorable weather accounted for little of the strength in December. ']
