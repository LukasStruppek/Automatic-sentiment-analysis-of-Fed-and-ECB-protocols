[' Housing construction was cited as potentially the most important demand sector of the economy that was likely to contribute to more moderate economic growth over the year ahead. As evidenced by nationwide data through the end of 1994, single-family housing starts had held up unexpectedly well despite sizable increases in home mortgage rates, but anecdotal reports from around the country had pointed to weakening demand for new homes for several months and continued to do so. Against the background of current mortgage rate levels and the rise that had occurred in home mortgage indebtedness, the members continued to anticipate softening demand for housing, at least in the single-family sector. The mild uptrend in the much smaller multifamily sector was likely to continue for some period, given low rental vacancy rates in a number of areas, and further improvement in nonresidential construction was likely to offset to some extent the overall slowing in housing construction.
