[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened somewhat further in November, and for October and November combined the deficit was well above its average rate in the third quarter. The value of exports of goods and services increased more slowly in the October-November period than in the third quarter, largely reflecting reduced growth of exported industrial supplies. The rise in the value of imports of goods and services for the October-November period was led by increased imports of non-oil industrial supplies and automotive, capital, and consumer goods. Available data for the fourth quarter of 1994 indicated continued growth in economic activity, though perhaps at a somewhat slower pace, in the major foreign industrial countries. ']
