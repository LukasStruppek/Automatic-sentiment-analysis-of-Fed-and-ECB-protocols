[" At this meeting, the Committee decided to retain the procedures that it had followed over the past year for providing greater information to the public about its policy actions and discussions. It was the judgment of the members that these procedures strike an appropriate balance between making the Committee's decisions and deliberations accessible to the public as soon and as fully as feasible, while safeguarding the Committee's flexibility in policymaking and preserving an unfettered deliberative process. The procedures in question involve the prompt announcement of the Committee's decisions and the release of minutes and transcripts of FOMC meetings. "]
