[' In their review of regional economic developments, members referred to widespread evidence of further growth in business activity, but a number also mentioned scattered signs of some softening in a few areas or industries. Several emphasized, however, that the anecdotal evidence did not currently point to any significant moderation in the overall growth of the economy. With regard to financial conditions, members commented that they saw little indication that policy tightening actions over the past year were constraining the availability of credit to any observable degree. Despite higher interest rates, financial conditions remained broadly supportive of further economic expansion. The performance of stock market prices and the relatively narrow quality spreads in debt markets attested to a considerable degree of confidence among investors. Members also took note of the accommodative lending policies of banking institutions. Those policies had encouraged rapid growth in consumer and business loans and evidently were contributing to the ongoing strength of the economic expansion. Some members expressed concern that a number of banks might have eased their lending standards unduly and thus assumed unwarranted risks in their loan portfolios. ']
