[' In their assessment of developments in key sectors of the economy, members referred to the sluggish behavior of non-auto retail sales in November and December, but they also noted that the available information on consumer spending during the first few weeks of this year was inconclusive with regard to the possible emergence of a slowing trend. Anecdotal commentary on retail sales was mixed, and evidence of some decline in January sales of motor vehicles needed to be evaluated with caution because of the introduction of a new reporting method. Consumer confidence was at a high level, but some members observed that consumer indebtedness had grown rapidly and was likely to exert a retarding effect on consumer spending at some point. In this regard, however, it was pointed out that rising consumer incomes had kept debt service burdens from increasing significantly thus far. On balance, the members believed that the growth in consumer spending probably would slow over the forecast horizon though such spending might be relatively well maintained for some period, given the ongoing expansion in jobs and incomes and the ready availability of financing to many consumers. In any event, the outlook for this sector of the economy, which was critical to any significant moderation in overall economic growth, was uncertain with regard to both the timing and the extent of possible slowing.
