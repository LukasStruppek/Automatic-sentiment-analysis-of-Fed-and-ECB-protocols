[' Messrs. Lindsey and Melzer dissented with respect to increases in both the swap line and the warehousing arrangement with the Exchange Stabilization Fund. They did not believe that the Committee had been provided sufficient information to assess whether developments in Mexico threatened U.S. financial stability, a possible justification for increased central bank lending on a short-term basis, Furthermore, they considered it inappropriate for the Federal Reserve to participate, directly or indirectly, in intermediate to long-term financing to facilitate debt restructuring. They were concerned that such participation in a fiscal policy matter might compromise, or appear to compromise, the independence of the monetary policy process. Mr. Lindsey added that the latter risks were significantly enhanced given the absence of Congressional authorization or more general public support for these measures. ']
