[" The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth of economic activity would slow substantially over the next several quarters and for some period thereafter would average less than the rate of increase in the economy's potential output. Consumer spending was projected to be well sustained for a time but to be restrained later by smaller gains in real incomes, the satisfaction of pent-up demands, and the lagged effects of higher interest rates on the demand for durable goods. Business outlays for new equipment were expected to decelerate substantially in response to higher financing costs and slower growth of sales and profits. Homebuilding was anticipated to soften a little in response to slower growth in jobs and income as well as to the increase that had occurred in mortgage rates. Recent developments in Mexico were expected to cut into exports in the near term, but the sustained economic growth elsewhere would keep export demand on an uptrend. Although there was considerable uncertainty regarding the fiscal outlook, in light of the Congressional intent to cut the federal deficit the forecast incorporated a somewhat greater degree of fiscal restraint than had been built into recent forecasts. In the staff's judgment, the economy currently was operating beyond its long-run, noninflationary capacity, and there remained a substantial risk that inflation could ratchet higher absent further monetary policy actions.
