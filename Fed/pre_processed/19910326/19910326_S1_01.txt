The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity weakened further in the opening months of 1991. In February, total nonfarm payroll employment fell sharply further, especially in manu facturing, and the civilian unemployment rate rose to 6.5 percent. Industrial output also declined markedly again in February, with cutbacks evident in a wide range of industries. Advance indicators point to further weakness in business fixed investment in coming months, notably in nonresidential construction. On the other hand, after declining considerably in previous months, retail sales turned up in February; consumer sentiment appears to have rebounded sharply in recent weeks. Housing starts jumped in February, retracing a sizable decline in January but remaining at a low level. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit increased somewhat in January but was considerably below its average rate in the fourth quarter. Energy prices fell substantially further in January and February, but prices of other consumer goods and services rose more rapidly than in preceding months. Wage increases have moderated in recent months.
