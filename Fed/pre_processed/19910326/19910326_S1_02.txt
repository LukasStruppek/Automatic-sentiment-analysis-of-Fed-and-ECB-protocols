Short-term interest rates have declined slightly since the Committee meeting on February 5-6. In longer-term markets, rates on Treasury bonds have risen appreciably, owing at least in part to heightened expectations of a recovery in U.S. economic activity. Risk premiums on corporate debt instruments have declined, and stock prices have moved up considerably on balance. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies increased very sharply over the intermeeting period.
