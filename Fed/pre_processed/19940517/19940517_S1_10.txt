[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was larger on average in January and February than it had been in the fourth quarter. The value of exports in the January-February period was sharply below the unusually strong level in the fourth quarter but was slightly higher than the levels recorded in the first three quarters of 1993. Exports were down in virtually all major trade categories; one important exception was semiconductors, for which exports continued to trend higher. Imports in the two-month period fell by less than exports; nearly all of the decline reflected reduced oil imports. Available indicators for the first quarter pointed to recovery in economic activity at a moderate pace on average in the major foreign industrial countries. Signs of recovery ranged from quite tentative in Japan to relatively well-established in the United Kingdom and Canada. ']
