[' Business inventories declined in March, reversing part of the large run-up in stocks that had occurred in the first two months of the year. For the first quarter as a whole, inventories rose at a slightly slower pace than in the second half of last year. In manufacturing, the accumulation in the first quarter retraced much of the drawdown that had taken place in previous months; the inventory-to-shipments ratio, already at a low level, edged still lower. Wholesale inventories were down on balance over the first quarter, with a large March decline more than retracing increases earlier in the year; the ratio of inventories to sales was well below the range prevailing over the last several years. Retail inventories expanded modestly in the first quarter, and the inventory-to-sales ratio fell slightly. ']
