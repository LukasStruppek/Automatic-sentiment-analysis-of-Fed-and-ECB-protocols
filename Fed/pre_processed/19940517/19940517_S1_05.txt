[' Nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply in March and April, in part reflecting a rebound in industries affected by earlier severe winter weather; for the first four months of the year, the average monthly rise exceeded the improved pace of the fourth quarter. Further large advances in employment in the March-April period were recorded in the services sector, notably at personnel supply services firms; hiring in construction was strong after earlier weather-related losses; and the number of jobs in manufacturing continued to expand, although at a somewhat slower pace than in previous months. The civilian unemployment rate registered another slight decline in April, to 6.4 percent, and the average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers remained at an unusually high level. ']
