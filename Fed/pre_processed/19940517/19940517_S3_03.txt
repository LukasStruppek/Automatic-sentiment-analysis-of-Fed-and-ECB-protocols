[" With regard to the outlook for key sectors of the economy, consumer expenditures were viewed by many members as likely to be well maintained, particularly for motor vehicles and other consumer durables. Reports from various parts of the country indicated that sales had tended in many areas to exceed retailers' expectations by a considerable margin in recent months. Some members noted, however, that sales had been less ebullient since late winter and cited factors that might work to restrain somewhat the growth of consumer spending. These included high and rising debt levels, declines in household wealth owing to the drop in stock and bond prices, and the effects on consumer confidence of ongoing workforce reductions associated with business restructuring. Higher interest rates also might limit the pace at which pent-up demands would continue to be satisfied. On balance, in the view of a number of members, growth in consumer spending seemed likely to moderate to a pace close to the growth in incomes. "]
