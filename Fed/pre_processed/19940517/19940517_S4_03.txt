[" In the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting adjustments to the degree of reserve pressure, all but one of the members indicated a preference for retaining a symmetric directive. Symmetry would be consistent with a judgment that further policy adjustment likely would not be needed during the intermeeting period ahead and, in particular, that additional tightening would not be triggered unless inflation pressures greater than those currently anticipated were to emerge. The adoption of a symmetric directive would not preclude an intermeeting consultation and possible adjustment by the Chairman on behalf of the Committee if such were warranted by intermeeting developments. One member expressed a preference for an asymmetric directive. In his view, a symmetric directive might be mistakenly interpreted both in the United States and abroad as a signal that the Committee believed that policy neutrality definitely had been achieved and that there was no need to allow for the possibility of further tightening.
