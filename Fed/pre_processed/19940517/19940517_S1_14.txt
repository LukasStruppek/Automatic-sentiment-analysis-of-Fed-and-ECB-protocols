[' Immediately after the meeting, open market operations were directed toward implementing the slightly less accommodative degree of reserve pressure sought by the Committee. Subsequently, on April 18, against the background of incoming data suggesting considerable momentum and diminishing slack in the economy and of indications that financial markets were less likely to be destabilized by a further policy action, the degree of accommodation in reserve pressures was reduced a little further. The federal funds rate rose 1/4 percentage point, to 3-1/2 percent, after the initial policy action; following the second policy move, the funds rate went up another 1/4 percentage point and generally remained near 3-3/4 percent. Over the intermeeting period, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged slightly above anticipated levels. ']
