[' Increases in labor costs continued to moderate in early 1994. The employment cost index for private industry workers rose more slowly in the first quarter of 1994 than in any quarter of 1993. The slowdown reflected more moderate growth in both wages and salaries and benefit costs. Hourly compensation increased at a slightly slower pace over the twelve months ending in March 1994 than over the previous year. In April, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on nonfarm payrolls increased moderately after having changed little over February and March. ']
