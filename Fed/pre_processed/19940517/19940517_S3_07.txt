[' In their discussion of the outlook for prices and wages, the members noted that broad measures of inflation remained subdued and increases in labor costs had been moderate. Nevertheless, they continued to be concerned that inflation could begin to rise if growth in excess of potential were to persist and margins of unutilized production resources were to shrink further, or even disappear. Production already had reached capacity limits in a number of industries, including motor vehicles and steel, and prices of some raw materials and intermediate goods had risen substantially over the past year. Ongoing efforts to expand production capacity through productivity-enhancing investment and the hiring of additional workers were likely to be of some help in meeting growing demands, but an increasing number of contacts were reporting that business firms were taking advantage of opportunities to adjust prices upward. There also were indications of shortages of qualified workers in some labor markets or industries, but to date there were only limited signs of upward wage pressures and these did not seem to signal a near-term emergence of general upward cost pressures on prices. Indeed, even with sales strong, many business contacts were reporting that intense competition, in part from imports, was curbing or negating efforts to raise prices. Firms were continuing to look primarily to improvements in productivity and quality to bolster their profit margins, although there also were reports that price discounting was lessening and that sales promotions were becoming less frequent. Price and wage pressures were most clearly evident and widespread in the construction industry, where resource constraints appeared to be most pronounced. ']
