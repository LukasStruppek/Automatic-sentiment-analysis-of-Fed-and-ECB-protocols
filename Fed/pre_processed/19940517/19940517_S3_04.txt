[" Members expected business fixed investment to continue to expand at a pace substantially above that of the economy as a whole. With production straining capacity limits in a number of industries and firms striving for cost savings and productivity improvements to maintain their competitiveness, real outlays for producers' durable equipment were likely to stay on a strong upward trend despite an anticipated deceleration in business output and the recently increased cost of external capital associated with higher interest rates and lower equity prices. It was noted in this connection that order books at producers of capital equipment had grown considerably. Nonresidential construction appeared to be rebounding from the disruptive effects of unusually severe winter weather conditions; however, the pattern of construction activity across the nation was mixed, with some areas of the country displaying considerable strength in activity and other areas still depressed. The construction of office buildings for the most part remained at very low levels, but anecdotal reports indicated that markets for office space, especially those that had been hard hit in recent years, seemed to be improving considerably in some locales. Business inventories remained quite lean by historical standards, and some reports suggested that efforts to augment stocks had been negated by strong sales. With survey reports indicating that order backlogs had grown and lead times on materials deliveries had lengthened, the possibility was increasing that desired inventory ratios might be adjusted upward and some pickup in inventory investment might get under way, especially in manufacturing where stocks-to-sales ratios recently had fallen to new lows.
