[' With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, all the members indicated that they could support a proposal to retain the current bias toward restraint. Several viewed such a bias as desirable because they continued to believe that the risks remained tilted, at least to some extent, toward rising inflation over time. In the circumstances an asymmetric directive would best reflect their views even if, as seemed likely, intermeeting developments did not prompt a policy tightening adjustment. Other members commented that a shift to a symmetric directive might be viewed as more consistent with the apparently diminished inflationary pressures. They agreed, however, that such a shift would be premature in the currently uncertain environment and might signal, inaccurately, that the Federal Reserve was less concerned about the possibility of a a modest upward trajectory in price inflation.
