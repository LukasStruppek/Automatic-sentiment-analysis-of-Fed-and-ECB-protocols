[' In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, members again focused on developments in labor markets and the extent to which rising cost pressures in those markets might be passed through to higher prices. The statistical and anecdotal information generally continued to point to tight labor markets and to a somewhat faster rise in labor compensation costs this year. Even so, the increases in such costs were still falling short of those that would have been anticipated on the basis of historical experience under similar labor market conditions. Moreover, the advance in the overall employment cost index in the third quarter, while perhaps understated to some extent, was appreciably below expectations. At the same time, business firms generally were not raising their prices sufficiently to compensate for faster increases in their labor costs, to the extent that the latter were occurring, evidently because of the persistence of intense competition in most markets. Indeed, with the notable exception of the overall consumer price index, the rate of inflation as measured by various broad price indexes had tended to ease marginally or at worst to stabilize over the past two years. Prices of farm commodities and industrial materials had declined considerably recently. ']
