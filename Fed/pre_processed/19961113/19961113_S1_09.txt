[' Growth of business fixed investment surged in the third quarter. Outlays for durable equipment picked up sharply, and new orders for business equipment remained on an upward trend.

Spending on nonresidential structures more than reversed a second- quarter decline; however, incoming data on contracts pointed to a continuation of the pattern of somewhat slower growth recorded thus far in 1996.
