[' The growth of nonfarm business inventories in the third quarter had exceeded earlier expectations, but members commented that the sizable rise appeared to have been largely voluntary and the overall level of inventories was still historically low in relation to sales. Against this background, inventory accumulation was likely to continue but at a slower pace in the current quarter. Beyond the near term, inventory investment was expected to become a more neutral factor in the performance of the economy, given the absence of incentives to build stocks relative to sales in a period of moderate growth in projected demand. The members recognized, however, that the prospective behavior of inventories remained subject to substantial uncertainties. ']
