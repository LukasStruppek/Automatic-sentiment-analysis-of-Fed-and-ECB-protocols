[' Total retail sales rose appreciably in September after having changed little on balance over July and August; for the third quarter as a whole, total retail sales edged higher after having expanded briskly in the first half of the year. September sales totals were boosted by strong spending at automotive dealers, food stores, and nondurable goods outlets. However, expenditures for furniture, appliances and other non-auto durable goods fell, and apparel sales weakened a little further. Housing starts declined in September from the unusually high level recorded in August and permits moved lower for a second straight month. Home sales were mixed, with sales of new homes well sustained in September while those of existing homes continued on a downtrend. ']
