[' M2 grew at a slower pace in September and October than it had over earlier months of the year; the weaker expansion resulted from a continuing rapid runoff in its liquid deposit components. Nonetheless, M2 was estimated to have grown for the year through October at a rate in the upper half of the Committees annual range. By contrast, M3 expanded at a substantially faster rate in September and October than it had earlier in the year, reflecting a surge in its large time deposit and other managed liability components to meet business demand for bank loans. For the year through October, M3 was estimated to have grown at a rate around the top of its annual range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had expanded moderately on balance over recent months and had remained in the middle portion of its range. ']
