The information reviewed at this meeting portrays a sluggish economy and a marked deterioration in business and consumer confidence. Total nonfarm pay roll employment was unchanged in October after rising slightly over the third quarter, and the civilian unemployment rate edged back up to 6.8 percent. Industrial production has been flat in recent months. Consumer spending increased considerably through the summer, in part because of a sizable rise in expendi tures on motor vehicles; sales of motor vehicles slowed in October, however. Real outlays for business equipment--especially for computers--have been rising, but nonresidential construction has continued to decline. Housing starts and home sales have weakened recently. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in July-August was significantly above its average rate in the second quarter. Wage and price increases have continued to trend downward.
