Business fixed investment continued to be bolstered by favorable fundamentals, including sustained expansion of business output, the flush cash position of many firms, readily available credit, and a still-favorable cost of capital. Equipment and software spending grew at a solid rate in the fourth quarter, though not quite as briskly as in the third quarter owing to a deceleration in spending outside the high-tech sector. By contrast, investment in nonresidential structures had edged down in recent months, with expenditures only for drilling and mining operations showing some strength amid flat outlays for manufacturing facilities and a decline in spending on office buildings.
