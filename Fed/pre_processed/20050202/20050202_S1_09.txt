Nonfarm inventories increased a bit more in the fourth quarter than they had in the third quarter. The buildup of inventories was widespread across manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers as well as across stages of production. Motor vehicle inventories were an exception, as motor vehicle manufacturers sought to reduce stocks of unsold light vehicles. The aggregate inventory-sales ratio outside of motor vehicles likely edged up in the fourth quarter but remained within the range that had prevailed since the middle of last year.
