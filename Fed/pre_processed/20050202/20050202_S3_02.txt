In preparation for the Federal Reserves semi-annual report to the Congress on the economy and monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for the years 2005 and 2006. As part of its continuing effort to improve its communications, the Committee had earlier decided to add one year to the forecast period so as to make the projections more useful to the public. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP were concentrated in the upper part of a 3-1/2 to 4 percent range for 2005; for 2006 the forecasts were in a slightly lower range of 3-1/4 to 3-3/4 percent, with a central tendency at 3-1/2 percent. These rates of growth were associated with a civilian unemployment rate in the range of 5 to 5-1/2 percent and a central tendency of 5-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 5 to 5-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006. The rate of inflation, as measured by the core PCE price index, was expected to remain fairly stable, with forecasts concentrated in the lower portion of a 1-1/2 to 2 percent range for both this year and next.
