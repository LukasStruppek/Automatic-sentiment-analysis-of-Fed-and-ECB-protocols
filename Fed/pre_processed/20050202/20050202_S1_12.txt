At its meeting on December 14, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2-1/4 percent. In its announcement of this decision, the Committee indicated that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability were roughly equal. The Committee also noted that output appeared to be growing at a moderate pace and labor market conditions continued to improve gradually, while inflation and inflation expectations remained well-contained. As a result, the Committee again judged that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely to be measured, although the path of policy would depend importantly on evolving economic prospects.
