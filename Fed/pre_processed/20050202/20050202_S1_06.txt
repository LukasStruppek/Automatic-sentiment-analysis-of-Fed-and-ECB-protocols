Real consumer spending expanded briskly in December and in the fourth quarter as a whole, with retail sales exhibiting widespread strength across categories. Expenditures on consumer services also continued to post solid increases. A surge in light vehicle sales in December pulled the average rate of sales during the fourth quarter slightly above the third-quarter pace. Real disposable personal income increased at a rapid rate at the end of the year--boosted in part by the special dividend payment by Microsoft; excluding this payment, real disposable personal income rose at a more moderate rate. Measures of consumer confidence remained favorable and consistent with sustained increases in spending.
