Residential housing activity remained buoyant in the fourth quarter. A rebound in single-family housing starts in December from a disappointing November brought the fourthquarter pace about in line with that earlier in the year. Sales of new and existing homes slipped some late in the year but remained robust. Mortgage rates had changed little since August and continued to support demand. Construction activity in the multifamily sector weakened a bit in November and December, but indicators of underlying demand pointed to a rebound in starts in January.
