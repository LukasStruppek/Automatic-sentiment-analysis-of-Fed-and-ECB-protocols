The Committees decision at its December meeting to increase the federal funds rate had been fully anticipated in financial markets, and reaction to the attendant statement was muted. The release of the minutes of the December meeting on January 4, however, triggered a significant upward revision in the anticipated path of monetary policy: Investors apparently read them as expressing more widespread concern among Committee members about inflation pressures than had been the case previously. Market participants viewed the generally favorable incoming data on economic activity as consistent with their expectations of firmer policy. Interest rates on intermediate-term Treasury securities rose in response to the revision to policy expectations, but longer-term yields were little changed over the intermeeting period. As yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities rose roughly in line with their nominal counterparts, longer-term inflation compensation remained about unchanged. Risk spreads on corporate bonds were stable at relatively low levels, consistent with favorable indicators of corporate credit quality. Broad stock indexes declined a bit over the intermeeting period. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar ended the period little changed on a trade-weighted basis, appreciating against the major European currencies but falling vis-Å•-vis other important trading partners.
