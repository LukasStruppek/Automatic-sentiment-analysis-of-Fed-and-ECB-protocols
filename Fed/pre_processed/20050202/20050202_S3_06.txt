A number of participants noted continued modest gains in employment, though some commented that, based on anecdotal information, job growth seemed to have picked up of late. The increase in aggregate demand was expected to be sufficient over coming quarters to allow the rate of unemployment to continue to edge lower even as more people return to the labor force. Participants noted considerable uncertainty about the sustainable rate of resource utilization and about structural productivity growth. One participant suggested that, given the range of uncertainty, output might already be at or close to potential. Others commented that recent studies did not on balance support a conclusion that structural labor market shifts had caused resource slack to be lower than commonly estimated and that the flat pattern of growth in wages and compensation suggested an absence of pressures in labor markets. However, unit labor costs had accelerated over 2004 owing to a tapering off in productivity growth. If that slowing reflected a moderation in structural productivity growth and if firms believed that the associated increases in the growth rate of labor costs were permanent, these cost pressures might be passed through to consumer prices fairly quickly to preserve profit margins. While participants generally felt that the pace of underlying productivity growth remained robust, careful attention would need to be paid to developments regarding unit labor costs and profit margins.
