The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is continuing to expand but at a relatively slow pace. Total nonfarm payroll employ ment has increased at a much reduced rate in recent months. Nevertheless, the civilian unemployment rate has remained in a narrow range for an extended period and was 5.3 percent in May. Industrial production increased substantially in May, largely reflecting a rebound in the manufacture of motor vehicles. Consumer spending has been sluggish in recent months; outlays for goods have declined while expenditures for services have increased at a slower pace. Business capital spending appears to have slackened a bit in the spring after a pickup earlier in the year. Residential construction has fallen to a relatively low level in recent months. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed in April from its average rate in the first quarter. Partly reflecting an unwinding of the earlier jump in prices of food and energy, consumer prices rose at a slower rate in April and May, while producer prices were unchanged over the two months. The latest data on wages suggest no improvement in underlying trends.
