Conditions in the industrial sector had improved somewhat in the previous months. Industrial output displayed solid growth in the third quarter after declining earlier in the year. A downturn in motor vehicle assemblies depressed overall manufacturing somewhat in August, but a step-up in auto production boosted it significantly in September. The strength in manufacturing in September was somewhat offset, however, by a decrease in energy production as temperatures returned to more normal ranges after being unusually high in July and August. In line with these patterns in output, capacity utilization in manufacturing, which had been at historically low levels, decreased slightly in August, then firmed in September.
