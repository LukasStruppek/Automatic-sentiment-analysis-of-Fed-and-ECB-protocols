Core consumer prices rose slightly in August and September, but headline consumer inflation was up a bit more, largely reflecting a run-up in gasoline prices. Energy prices also boosted overall consumer inflation over the past twelve months, while core consumer inflation moved lower over the same period. At the producer level, core prices were about unchanged during August and September, but rising energy and food prices led to somewhat larger increases in the prices of total finished goods. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls edged down in September. The increase in earnings during the previous twelve months was a bit below that during the previous year.
