Labor markets appeared to be stabilizing as private nonfarm payrolls grew in September for the first time since January, and employment losses in July and August turned out to be smaller than data initially had indicated. The largest employment gain in September was in the business services sector, which includes temporary help supply firms. Employment also increased in most other major industries in September, with the exceptions of manufacturing and wholesale trade. Even in these sectors, the pace of job loss was somewhat slower than the declines of previous months. Aggregate hours of private production workers and the average workweek were both unchanged in September. The unemployment rate in September remained at 6.1 percent.
