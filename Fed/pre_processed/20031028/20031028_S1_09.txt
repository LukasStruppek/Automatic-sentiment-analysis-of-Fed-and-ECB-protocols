Manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles fell further in August after edging down in July. Manufacturers ran off stocks at a fairly rapid pace in both months, while wholesalers and retailers excluding motor vehicle and parts dealers recorded small declines in stocks in August after accumulations in July. Generally small changes in shipments and sales in the July-August period kept book-value inventory-sales ratios about flat at very low levels.
