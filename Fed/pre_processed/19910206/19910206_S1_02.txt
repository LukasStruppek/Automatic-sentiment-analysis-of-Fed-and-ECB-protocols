Short-term interest rates have fallen consider ably since the Committee meeting on December 18, while rates in longer-term markets are unchanged to down slightly. The Board of Governors approved a reduction in the discount rate from 7 to 6-1/2 percent on December 18 and a further reduction to 6 percent on February 1. In foreign exchange markets, the trade weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has declined somewhat on balance over the intermeeting period. Growth of M2 remained sluggish in December and January; expansion of M3 picked up in January from the very slow pace of recent months. For the year 1990, M2 and M3 expanded at rates in the lower portions of the Committee's ranges for the year. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have been near the midpoint of its monitoring range for the year.
