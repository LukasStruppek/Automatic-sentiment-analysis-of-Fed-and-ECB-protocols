 In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants generally agreed that the incoming data indicated that output and employment were increasing only slowly and at rates well below those recorded earlier in the year Although participants considered it unlikely that the economy would reenter a recession, many expressed concern that output growth, and the associated progress in reducing the level of unemployment, could be slow for some time Participants noted a number of factors that were restraining growth, including low levels of household and business confidence, heightened risk aversion, and the still weak financial conditions of some households and small firms A few participants noted that economic recoveries were often uneven and were typically slow following downturns triggered by financial crises A number of participants observed that the sluggish pace of growth and continued high levels of slack left the economy exposed to potential negative shocks Nevertheless, participants judged the economic recovery to be continuing and generally expected growth to pick up gradually next year
