[' Industrial production increased sharply in October and November. Manufacturing accounted for all the gain over the two months, with the rise partly reflecting a continuing rebound in the production of motor vehicles and parts. Elsewhere in manufacturing, strong advances were recorded in the output of computers and non-auto durable consumer goods. The sharp expansion in production was associated with substantial increases in the rate of utilization of industrial capacity in October and November. ']
