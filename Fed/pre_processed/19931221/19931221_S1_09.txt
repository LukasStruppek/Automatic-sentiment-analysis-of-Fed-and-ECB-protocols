[" Business inventories were little changed in October, with reductions in manufacturing and wholesale stocks nearly offsetting increases at the retail level. A moderate further decline in manufacturers' inventories in October was concentrated among producers of aircraft and parts, where stocks have been contracting for more than two years; the stocks-to-shipments ratio for manufacturing as a whole fell to its lowest level in recent years. In the wholesale sector, inventories declined in October after changing little in September, and the ratio of inventories to sales remained in the middle of its range over the past several years. At the retail level, stocks increased considerably further; with sales expanding vigorously, however, the ratio of stocks to sales edged lower and this ratio also was in the middle of its range over the past several years.
