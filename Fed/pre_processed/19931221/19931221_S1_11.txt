[' Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices pointed to little change in inflation trends, although prices of some commodities and industrial materials had firmed recently. Producer prices of finished goods were unchanged in November after declining in October and over the third quarter. In November, a large drop in the prices of finished energy goods offset a rebound in the prices of other finished goods. Producer prices for nonfood, non-energy finished goods were about unchanged over the twelve months ended in November. At the consumer level, prices of items other than food and energy advanced moderately in November; the twelve-month increase in this price measure was a little smaller than the rise over the comparable period ended in November 1992. Average hourly earnings edged up in November; for the twelve months ended in November, these earnings were up by a smaller amount than over the preceding year. ']
