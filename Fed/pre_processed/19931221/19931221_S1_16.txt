[" Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened appreciably in November; both aggregates had risen at somewhat faster rates since late summer than earlier in the year. Ml growth remained brisk in November, and money funds included in M2 apparently benefited from a slowdown in inflows to bond funds in the wake of the earlier decline in bond prices. The pickup in M3 growth reflected a surge in term Eurodollar deposits as well as faster growth of M2. For the year through November, M2 and M3 were estimated to have grown at rates somewhat above the lower end of the Committee's ranges for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had expanded moderately in recent months, and for the year through November it was estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.
