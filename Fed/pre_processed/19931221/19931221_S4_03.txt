[' Members who could support an unchanged policy stance also indicated their acceptance of a directive that was not biased in either direction with regard to possible adjustments in the degree of reserve pressure during the intermeeting period. Some observed that while the flow of economic reports during this period was likely to underscore the marked strengthening of the economy, those reports mainly would cover developments in the fourth quarter, and from a monetary policy perspective the members were more interested in knowing something about the extent of the follow-through strength early in the new year. Moreover, the members recognized that any tightening move would represent a turn in policy that might well have a greater-than-usual effect on financial markets. This prospect argued for taking such an action at a meeting, with the benefit of a full Committee review of the implications for future growth and inflation pressures of a wide variety of emerging developments--including those in money, credit, and financial markets--rather than an intermeeting action based on an asymmetric directive. In the view of one member, a tightening action over the coming intermeeting period would incur an undue risk of an exaggerated response in financial markets, given the likelihood of thin trading markets around year-end; and since a policy move should be postponed, a symmetrical directive seemed appropriate.
