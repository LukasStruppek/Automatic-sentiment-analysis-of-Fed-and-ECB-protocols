[' With respect to fiscal policy, members referred to the prospects for further cutbacks in defense spending that probably would continue to be offset only in part by growth in federal government purchases of other goods and services. However, net reductions in government purchases were expected to diminish over the projection horizon. Likewise, adverse effects on spending of the rise in tax rates on higher incomes would tend to be concentrated in the first half of 1994, and the impact on spending over the months ahead might well be relatively limited because many taxpayers probably had anticipated the higher taxes and had taken measures to mitigate or spread out their effects or would meet new tax obligations partly out of savings. Proposed health care reform legislation would exert a restraining effect on the economy, should it be enacted, owing to mandated cost increases on employers. If this form of financing were adopted, however, the legislation might have little, or perhaps even a favorable, effect on the federal deficit. ']
