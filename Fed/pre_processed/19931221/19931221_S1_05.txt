[' Total nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably further in November. Another substantial increase in jobs was recorded in the services industries, notably in health and business services. Construction employment was up significantly further after registering modest gains on balance over the first three quarters of 1993. In manufacturing, there were back-to-back increases in jobs in October and November following seven consecutive monthly declines, and both overtime hours and the average workweek remained at a high level. Most of the November expansion in factory jobs occurred in the motor vehicle and capital goods industries. The civilian unemployment rate fell considerably in November, to 6.4 percent. ']
