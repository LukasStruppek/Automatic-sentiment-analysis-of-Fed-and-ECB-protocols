[' It also was noted that rising inflationary pressures often were accompanied by a pickup in credit demands, and there was no evidence of any surge in such demands. However, the expansion of overall nonfinancial debt had strengthened to a degree. Moreover, in the view of some members, the rise in long-term interest rates and in gold prices might well have been caused in part by heightened inflation concerns. Members also cited scattered examples of greater price pressures, notably the prices of lumber and some other building materials and of related efforts to pass on the added costs through higher prices on new homes in some areas. Despite the absence of any general indication of rising inflation, a number of members expressed concern about the potential for increasing inflationary pressures in the economy and saw a need to monitor possible future sources of inflation with special care over the period ahead, especially in light of the considerable lags between monetary policy actions and their effects on prices.
