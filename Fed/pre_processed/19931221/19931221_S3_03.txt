[' With regard to the outlook for key sectors of the economy, consumer expenditures were seen as likely to continue to provide vital support to the expansion even though increases in consumer spending were not likely to be maintained at recent rates. Members noted that the improved consumer confidence and increased spending were reflected in a somewhat greater willingness to incur debt, at least in the context of reduced interest rates. Some members cautioned, however, that growth in consumer expenditures had exceeded gains in incomes for an extended period, insofar as could be judged from available data, and an already low saving rate seemed likely to limit the potential growth in such spending. Moreover, the negative impact of increased tax rates on high incomes seemed likely to be felt especially during the first half of 1994, though the extent of that impact on consumer spending remained uncertain. On the positive side, members cited a number of developments that would tend to bolster overall consumer expenditures, including lower energy costs, reduced income taxes for many individuals stemming from indexing, and lower interest charges on various kinds of debt. More generally, the rise in consumer confidence seemed to be related to perceptions of improving employment opportunities despite continuing announcements of sizable workforce reductions by some large firms.
