[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to widespread indications, both statistical and anecdotal, of a marked strengthening in economic activity and much improved business and consumer confidence in recent months. The rate of economic growth could be expected to moderate during the early months of 1994 from what currently appeared to be an unsustainable pace, but the members viewed the extent of such moderation as a key uncertainty in the outlook. A number of members observed that a sharp slowing of the expansion early next year, similar to the slowdown after the surge in activity during the closing months of 1992, could not be ruled out. However, most saw the gains in the economy as more solidly based than earlier in the expansion, and they generally expected the economy to settle into a pattern of moderate growth over coming quarters at a trend rate close to or somewhat above the economy's long-run potential. With regard to the outlook for inflation, the members saw little evidence in available measures of prices and wages or in other indicators that any significant change might already have occurred in underlying inflation trends. Nonetheless, views varied somewhat with regard to the outlook and ranged from expectations of some modest further decline in the core rate of inflation to concerns about the possibility of some acceleration in the context of diminishing margins of unemployed production resources and an accommodative monetary policy as reflected in low real short-term interest rates and continued rapid growth in narrow measures of money and reserves.
