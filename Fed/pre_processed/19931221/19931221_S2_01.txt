[' The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, after a strong fourth-quarter advance, the economy would expand at a more moderate rate in 1994. Consumer spending was projected to decelerate to a rate more in line with the growth of disposable income. Business fixed investment was expected to advance briskly, although not quite as rapidly as in 1993, and further gains in homebuilding activity likely would be concentrated in the first half of the year. Exports were projected to strengthen somewhat, bolstered by a modest pickup in foreign economic growth. Fiscal restraint was expected to exert a substantial drag on spending, through both falling government defense purchases and higher taxes. In light of the limited margins of slack in labor and product markets, the ongoing expansion was projected to be associated with only a slight further reduction in inflation. ']
