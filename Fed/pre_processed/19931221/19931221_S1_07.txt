[' Retail sales were up moderately in November after a large advance in October. Motor vehicle sales surged in October and remained at the higher level in November, apparently reflecting in part favorable financing terms, small price increases--adjusted for quality improvements--on 1994 models, and generous incentives on pickup trucks from some manufacturers. Sales of apparel, furniture and appliances, and other durable goods also were strong on balance over October and November. Housing starts rose substantially in November; starts of single-family units reached their highest level since early 1987, but starts of multifamily units edged lower. Sales of both new and existing homes remained robust in October. ']
