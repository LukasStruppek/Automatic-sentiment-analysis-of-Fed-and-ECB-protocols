 The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) provided a summary of domestic and global financial developments over the intermeeting period Broad measures of financial conditions had tightened somewhat in recent weeks, with US equity prices lower, the foreign exchange value of the dollar moderately higher, and longer-term Treasury yields up a little Market participants pointed to a range of factors contributing to the decline in stock prices, including concerns about the outlook for trade policy both in the United States and abroad, the potential for increased regulatory oversight of US technology companies, and incoming data suggesting some moderation in global economic growth The rise in nominal US Treasury yields was associated with an increase in inflation compensation that, in turn, seemed to reflect a firming in inflation data as well as a notable rise in crude oil prices Judging from federal funds futures quotes, the expected path of the federal funds rate changed relatively little over the intermeeting period While term LIBOR (London interbank offered rates) had widened relative to comparable-maturity OIS (overnight index swap) rates in recent months, the cost of dollar funding through the foreign exchange swap market had not risen to the same degree Recent usage of standing US dollar liquidity swap lines had been low, consistent with a view that the recent widening in LIBOR-OIS spreads did not reflect increased funding pressures or rising concerns about the condition of financial institutions
