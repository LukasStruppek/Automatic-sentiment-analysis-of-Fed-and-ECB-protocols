 Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace Labor market conditions had shown some improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remained elevated Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector had strengthened further, but fiscal policy was restraining economic growth The Committee expected that, with appropriate monetary policy accommodation, economic growth would proceed at a moderate pace and result in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels that the Committee judged consistent with its dual mandate Members generally continued to anticipate that, with longer-term inflation expectations stable and persisting slack in resource utilization, inflation over the medium term would likely run at or below the Committee's 2 percent objective
