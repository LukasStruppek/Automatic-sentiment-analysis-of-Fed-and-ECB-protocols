[' Most market interest rates were up somewhat on balance since the August meeting. Short-term rates, which had risen prior to the meeting in anticipation of a smaller policy move, increased modestly further after the Federal Reserve tightened and then changed little over the next several weeks. Subsequently, however, these rates began to move higher in response to incoming economic data that were seen as pointing to the potential for greater inflation in the future and hence to further firming in reserve conditions. Long-term yields fell following the policy tightening, but these declines were erased within a few days, and rates later rose noticeably further in response to the incoming data. Most major indexes of equity prices were up on balance over the intermeeting period despite price declines near the end of the period. ']
