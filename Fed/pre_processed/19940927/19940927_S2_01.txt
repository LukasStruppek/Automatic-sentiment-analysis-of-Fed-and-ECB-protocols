[" The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth in economic activity would slow appreciably over the next several quarters, dropping briefly below the rate of increase in the economy's potential output. According to a staff analysis, the economy already was operating at its long-run capacity, and the forecast assumed that monetary policy would not accommodate any continuing tendency for aggregate demand to expand at a pace that could foster sustained higher inflation. Growth in consumer expenditures was projected to moderate next year as spending on consumer durables lost some momentum in the context of diminishing pent-up demands, the rise in borrowing costs, and smaller gains in income. After an extended period of very rapid increases, growth in business fixed investment also was expected to slow appreciably, partly reflecting less favorable financial conditions and partly the slower pace of output growth. Homebuilding would be damped by higher financing costs, though activity in this sector was expected to remain well above the depressed levels reached in recent years. With the economy operating close to its long-run potential, no further reduction in the core rate of inflation was anticipated over the forecast horizon. Consumer price inflation was projected to be elevated over the near term--by some pass-through of the ongoing run-up in materials prices and by higher import prices--before settling down again. "]
