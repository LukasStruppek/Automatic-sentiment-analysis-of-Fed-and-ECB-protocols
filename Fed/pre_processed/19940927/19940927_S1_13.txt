[' Immediately after the conclusion of the August meeting, the Board of Governors approved a 1/2 percentage point increase in the discount rate to a level of 4 percent. The Committee permitted the full amount of the increase to pass through to interest rates in the market for reserves, and the federal funds rate rose about 1/2 percentage point to an average of around 4-3/4 percent. As indicated in an announcement released on the day of the meeting, the Committee did not anticipate that further policy tightening was likely to be needed for a time, given the substantial nature of the policy move. Accordingly, open market operations over the intermeeting period were conducted with a view to maintaining the less accommodative degree of pressure on reserve positions implemented just after the August meeting, and the federal funds rate remained near 4-3/4 percent. In accordance with the usual cresting of seasonal demands for discount credit at this time of the year, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing rose over much of the period but began to edge lower subsequently. Borrowing averaged near anticipated levels. ']
