[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented on continuing indications of a robust expansion in business activity, with output near maximum sustainable levels. They still viewed significant slowing in the pace of the expansion as a reasonable expectation, though they acknowledged that signs of such slowing currently were limited and in particular that the most recent data indicated a greater probability of somewhat more strength in aggregate demand than had appeared to be developing during the late spring and early summer. The policy tightening actions implemented earlier in the year seemed to have elicited only a mild response thus far in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. However, much of the retarding effects of those actions, including the recent sizable tightening in August, probably had not yet been felt in the economy. In light of the strength of aggregate demand and lags in the effects of policy, the risks of some rise in inflation rates probably had increased. How large this rise might be or when it might be reversed was very difficult to predict at this point. However, indications of a persisting pickup in inflation would be a matter of considerable concern, and further developments would need to be monitored with special care in light of the Committee's longstanding commitment to containing inflation and moving over time toward price stability to foster the maximum, sustainable performance of the economy.
