[' M2 and M3 declined in August after expanding moderately in July, and data available for September pointed to little further change in either aggregate. The August decline in M2 reflected weakness in most of its liquid components that may have been induced to a considerable extent by the rise, which began early this year, in the opportunity costs of holding such accounts. The decline in M3 was associated with a sharp drop in institution-only money funds in response to the increase in market yields, but the weakness in this broader aggregate was limited by the brisk issuance of large-denomination time deposits as banks continued to rely on managed liabilities to fund credit growth. For the year through August, M2 and M3 grew at rates slightly above the lower ends of their respective ranges for 1994. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months. ']
