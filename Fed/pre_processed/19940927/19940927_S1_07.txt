[' Consumer spending remained on a solid upward trend. Retail sales rose considerably in August after holding steady in July. Sales of goods other than motor vehicles registered sizable increases in both July and August. Sales of motor vehicles, which had been constrained in recent months by shortages of popular domestic models, rebounded in August. Housing starts in July and August averaged slightly less than their second-quarter rate. Single-family starts had leveled off in recent months after declining earlier in the year; multifamily starts, though erratic from month to month, had been drifting higher. ']
