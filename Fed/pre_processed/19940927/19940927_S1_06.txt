[' Industrial production rose sharply in August after sizable gains in previous months. The August advance reflected a large increase in manufacturing output that was partly offset by declines in mining production and electricity generation; much of the strength in manufacturing resulted from a large rise in the output of motor vehicles stemming from unusually rapid retooling for the new model year. Elsewhere in manufacturing, production of office and computing equipment continued to expand briskly, and output of industrial equipment was up significantly. Total utilization of industrial capacity rose further in August from already high levels. ']
