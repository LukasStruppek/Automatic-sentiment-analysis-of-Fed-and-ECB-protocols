[' Consumer prices rose a little faster in July and August than their average pace for the first half of the year. The recent pickup in consumer inflation reflected large increases in energy prices as well as somewhat higher food prices; excluding the food and energy components, consumer price advances had remained moderate. Prices rose briskly at the producer level in July and August as prices of finished energy goods surged and prices of finished foods turned up after declining over the first half of the year. For items other than finished foods and energy, the increase over the July-August period was a little faster than in the first half of the year. Recent data indicated little change in wage trends. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers rose in August at about the rate observed over the previous twelve months. ']
