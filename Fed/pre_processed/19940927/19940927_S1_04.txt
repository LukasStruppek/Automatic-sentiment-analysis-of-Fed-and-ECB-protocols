[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the pace of economic expansion remained substantial, though it appeared to have moderated slightly in recent months. Final sales, especially of consumer goods, had firmed during the summer months while inventory investment apparently had slowed after a second-quarter surge. Manufacturing activity, bolstered by a pickup in production of motor vehicles, had been rising briskly, and the trend of payroll hiring remained strong. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices had been somewhat larger in recent months, and prices of materials had remained under considerable upward pressure. ']
