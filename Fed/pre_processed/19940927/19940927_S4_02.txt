[" In the course of the Committee's discussion, a number of members commented that the behavior of the monetary and credit aggregates should be taken into account in the evaluation of the current stance of monetary policy. While various money and related measures had for many years proved unreliable to a greater or lesser extent in gauging economic prospects, the weak growth in a wide array of these measures could not be entirely disregarded as a possible indicator of the degree of monetary restraint and argued for caution in implementing any further policy tightening. One member noted, however, that the slow growth in the narrow measures of reserves and money followed an extended period of rapid expansion and their recent weakness might not be indicative of constrained liquidity at this point. Moreover, the ready availability of bank credit and the receptivity of financial markets more generally argued that many borrowers, including small and medium-size businesses, currently had access to ample financing.
