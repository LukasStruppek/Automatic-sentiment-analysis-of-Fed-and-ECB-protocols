Several emphasized in this regard that although the risk of rising inflation might have receded, it was still present, especially in light of the persistence to date of very tight labor markets and relatively robust economic growth. In these circumstances, while an easing move was warranted to provide some insurance against undesirably tight domestic financial conditions, many members saw the need for a cautious policy action. A more sizable policy move at this point might convey an exaggerated impression of the Committee's current thinking regarding the extent of downside risks in the economy. "]
