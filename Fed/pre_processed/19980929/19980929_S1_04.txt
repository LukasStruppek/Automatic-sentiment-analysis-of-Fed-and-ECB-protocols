[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding at a moderate rate. Growth of private domestic final demand had slowed from its pace in the first half of the year, though it was still relatively robust, and reduced spending on U.S. exports and rising import competition were exerting appreciable restraint on overall activity, as was a slowing in inventory investment. Reflecting the moderation in growth from the first half of the year, total payroll employment was trending up at a somewhat slower pace. Despite the pressures on labor resources associated with still-tight labor markets, trends in wages and prices remained stable. ']
