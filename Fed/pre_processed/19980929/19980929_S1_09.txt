[' Business inventory accumulation eased further in July after having slowed sharply in the second quarter, and inventory-sales ratios remained moderate. Stockbuilding in manufacturing was at a somewhat lower rate in July than in the second quarter, and the stock-shipments ratio for the sector stayed a little above the low level that had prevailed over the past year. At the wholesale level, a further decline in inventories reflected additional reductions in motor vehicles; the inventory-shipments ratio remained in the upper part of its narrow range for the past year. In the retail sector, a sharp drop in stocks at automotive dealerships more than offset a rise in stocks of other goods. The aggregate inventory-sales ratio for the retail sector was at a relatively low level. ']
