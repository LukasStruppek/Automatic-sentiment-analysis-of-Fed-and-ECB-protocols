[' Nominal retail sales were unchanged in March and declined in April after having increased rapidly in earlier months. Weaker sales of motor vehicles contributed to the overall sluggishness of retail activity in March and April, but spending on many other categories of goods, both durable and nondurable, also was down over the two-month period after having previously grown strongly. Expenditures on services advanced further through March (latest available data) even though unseasonably mild weather held down outlays for heating. While retail sales had slowed recently, the latest surveys indicated that consumer sentiment had risen further from an already markedly high level. ']
