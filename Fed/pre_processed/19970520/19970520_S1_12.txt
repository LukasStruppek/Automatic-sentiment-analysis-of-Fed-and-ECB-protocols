[' At its meeting on March 25, 1997, the Committee issued a directive that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions; the firming of policy was taken in light of continued rapid growth of aggregate demand in the first quarter and the attendant greater risk of heightened pressures on resources and an upturn in inflation. Although further policy tightening might be needed at some point, the Committee did not believe that developments during the intermeeting period were likely to require an adjustment, and thus the directive did not include a presumption about adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the expansion of M2 and M3 over coming months. ']
