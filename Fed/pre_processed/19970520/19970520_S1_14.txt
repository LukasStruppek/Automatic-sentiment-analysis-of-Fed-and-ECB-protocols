[' Market interest rates generally posted small mixed changes over the intermeeting period. Most private short-term rates increased only a little in response to the March policy action, which had been largely anticipated by market participants. Intermediate- and long-term yields rose over the early part of the intermeeting period, responding mostly to incoming data suggesting that growth in aggregate demand and output remained strong; these increases were subsequently more than reversed, however, as later information indicated that economic growth was moderating and price inflation remained subdued and on news of an agreement to balance the federal budget. Major indexes of stock market prices fluctuated substantially over the period but they rose considerably on balance. ']
