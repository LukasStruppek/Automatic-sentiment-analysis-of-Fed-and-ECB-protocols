[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity had slowed after having surged in late 1996 and earlier this year. Consumer spending appeared to be increasing at a considerably slower pace after the spurt in the first quarter, while business fixed investment remained on a strong uptrend, and the demand for housing seemed to be well maintained. Growth of labor demand had moderated somewhat from the rapid pace at the beginning of the year, but labor markets remained tight and worker compensation appeared to be accelerating gradually. Despite the upward drift in labor costs, underlying price inflation was still subdued. ']
