In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of progress toward price stability, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve restraint might or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the inter meeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of both M2 and M3 over the period from September through December at annual rates of about 1 to 2 percent.
