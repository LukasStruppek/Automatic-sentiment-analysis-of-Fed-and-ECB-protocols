The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was mixed in late spring and early summer. The labor market remained weak, and industrial production improved only slightly. Consumer spending, however, advanced further, with brisk growth in expenditures on autos and other durables and more modest expansion in other categories. Homebuilding continued at a robust rate, business spending improved somewhat, and federal government expenditures remained elevated, but these gains were partially offset by fiscal restraint at the state and local government levels. Despite a recent uptick in consumer prices, year-over-year consumer inflation remained at a very low level.
