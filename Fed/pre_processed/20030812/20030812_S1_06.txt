Real personal consumption expenditures grew in June and in the second quarter as a whole, largely reflecting a brisk rise in purchases of motor vehicles and other durable goods. Consumption of other goods rose more moderately. Declines in spending on energy in June held down growth in services expenditures. Real disposable income posted a modest gain in the second quarter, and likely was lifted further in July by reduced tax withholding and by refund checks that were mailed out. Consumer confidence readings were mixed in June and July but remained well above their lows earlier in the year.
