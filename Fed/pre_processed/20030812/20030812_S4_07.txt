On September 15, 2003, the Committee met to review its practices regarding the communication of its policy decisions and its assessment of the risks to its objectives of fostering sustainable economic growth and price stability. After a detailed discussion of the issues, the Committee elected not to make substantial changes in its current approach to the policy announcement at this time. Although a variety of views was expressed, most members felt that current practices were generally appropriate in providing information to the public about the rationale for the Committee's decisions and its views about the risks to future economic performance. Nonetheless, members recognized that going forward they might, from time to time, consider changes that might improve the Committee's communication of its assessment of the economic situation.
