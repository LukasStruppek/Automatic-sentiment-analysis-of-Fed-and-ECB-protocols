Overall consumer prices rose a bit in June, led by increases in the volatile food and energy categories. Core consumer prices, however, were unchanged for the month. Over the twelve-month period ending in June, the increase in core consumer prices as measured by both the consumer price index and the chain-type personal consumption expenditure index was notably lower than the rise of the previous year. Higher energy costs pushed up the producer price index in June, but core producer prices ticked down for the month, leaving them slightly below their levels twelve months prior. With regard to labor costs, July average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls advanced at about the same rate as in June. The employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers rose less in the second quarter than in the first quarter. The twelve-month increase was somewhat lower than that for the previous year.
