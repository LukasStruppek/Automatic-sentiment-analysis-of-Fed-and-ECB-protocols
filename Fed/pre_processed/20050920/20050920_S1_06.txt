Activity in the housing sector remained brisk. Starts of new single-family homes in July were slightly above their average level for the first half of the year. New home sales advanced further in July, and existing home sales stayed elevated. Mortgage rates remained low and supported demand. Prices of existing homes again rose briskly, while price appreciation for new homes moderated somewhat.
