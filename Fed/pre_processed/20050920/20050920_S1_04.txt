Industrial production increased only slightly in August; the staff estimated that the curtailment of activity as a result of Hurricane Katrina shaved 0.3 percent from the index. Petroleum refining and crude oil and natural gas extraction were especially hard hit by the storm. The output of utilities declined in August after surging earlier in the summer in response to unseasonably warm weather. Higher production of motor vehicles and parts boosted manufacturing output. After slowing in the second quarter, the pace of production in the high-tech sector accelerated somewhat in recent months, owing to increased output of communications equipment and semiconductors. Overall capacity utilization through August remained close to its highest level since December 2000.
