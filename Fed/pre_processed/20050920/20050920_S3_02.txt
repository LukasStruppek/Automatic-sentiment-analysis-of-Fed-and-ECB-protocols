Meeting participants recognized that Hurricane Katrina would have significant effects on the U.S. economy, but the size and timing of those effects were uncertain. Economic activity in the Gulf Coast region would be disrupted by the destruction of capital and the displacement of a large population, perhaps for an extended period. Moreover, damage to infrastructure for extracting and processing oil and natural gas was expected to be substantial, with significant near-term implications for energy prices and the national economy, and the projected track of Hurricane Rita raised additional concerns. In that environment, the prices of crude oil, natural gas, and gasoline likely would remain elevated and subject to considerable volatility, particularly given the limited spare capacity available in energy extraction and refining industries. Participants noted that very substantial rebuilding would probably be underway soon, supported importantly by government programs. The pace at which reconstruction activity would take place, however, was uncertain, as it depended in part on factors that were still difficult to assess, such as how quickly the affected areas could again be made habitable. On balance, participants thought that there would likely be a significant shift in the timing of aggregate economic activity over the next several quarters but probably little effect on the economy's intermediate-term growth prospects. Several participants voiced concern that the effects of the hurricane were likely to add to already considerable pressures on prices.
