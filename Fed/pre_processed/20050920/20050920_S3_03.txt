For the nation as a whole, participants noted that household spending had been fairly robust before the hurricane, supported by strong advances in income and continuing gains in wealth that reflected in part further large increases in home prices. Most anecdotal information supported the indications from available data that activity in housing markets generally remained brisk. The termination of some inducements to purchase motor vehicles was expected to retard expenditures on consumer durables in the latter part of this year. The reduction in real disposable incomes caused by large increases in consumer energy prices was also anticipated to restrain consumer spending, with business contacts indicating that retail outlets that typically serve lower- and middle-income households could see particular weakness. The reduction in spending as a result of higher energy prices and hurricane-related dislocations could be augmented by a weakening of consumer attitudes. Many of the restraining effects were thought likely to dissipate over time, however. Retail energy prices were likely to retrace at least a portion of the post-hurricane increase, and consumer confidence should rebound. Moreover, demands for consumer durables, as well as housing, would receive support as hurricane victims repaired or replaced lost property, with help from insurance payments and government transfers. Although uncertainties about the outlook for spending had increased, it appeared that, over time, consumption would probably expand at a moderate pace--perhaps a little below the pace of income growth once the increases in house prices slowed to more historically typical rates.
