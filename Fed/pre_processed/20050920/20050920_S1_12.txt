The Committee's decision at its August meeting was widely expected in financial markets and evoked little price reaction. Over the intermeeting period, however, investors marked down their expectations for the path of policy, partly in response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. Nominal Treasury yields decreased about in line with the revision to policy expectations. Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities fell a bit more than their nominal counterparts, leaving inflation compensation slightly higher. Spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds were little changed over the intermeeting period, but those on speculative-grade bonds increased from very low levels. Major equity indexes appeared to be supported by lower interest rates and posted modest gains despite the increases in energy prices. The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciated slightly over the intermeeting period.
