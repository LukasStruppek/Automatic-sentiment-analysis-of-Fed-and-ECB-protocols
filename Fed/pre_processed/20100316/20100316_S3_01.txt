 In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, participants agreed that economic activity continued to strengthen and that the labor market appeared to be stabilizing Incoming information on economic activity received over the intermeeting period was somewhat mixed but generally confirmed that the economic recovery was likely to proceed at a moderate pace On the positive side, recent data pointed to significant gains in retail sales, a substantial pickup in business spending on equipment and software, and a further expansion of goods exports Moreover, the latest labor market readings had been mildly encouraging, with a considerable increase in temporary employment, especially in the manufacturing and information technology sectors However, housing starts had remained flat at a depressed level, investment in nonresidential structures was still declining, and state and local government expenditures were being depressed by lower revenues Moreover, consumer sentiment continued to be damped by very weak labor market conditions, and firms remained reluctant to add to payrolls or to commit to new capital projects Participants saw recent inflation readings as suggesting a slightly greater deceleration in consumer prices than had been expected In light of stable longer-term inflation expectations and the likely continuation of substantial resource slack, they generally anticipated that inflation would be subdued for some time
