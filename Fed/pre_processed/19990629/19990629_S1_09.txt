Information on shipments of nondefense capital goods in April and May suggested that business investment in durable equipment picked up substantially in the second quarter from the already brisk pace of the first quarter. Shipments of high-tech equipment, notably computers, were particularly robust over the April-May period. In addition, business demand for motor vehicles continued to be strong, particularly for medium and heavy trucks for which the backlog of unfilled orders was still quite large. By contrast, nonresidential construction activity weakened in April (latest data) after a rise in the first quarter, and available information on contracts for future construction pointed to sluggish building activity for some period ahead.
