Business investment spending, which featured exceptional growth in expenditures for producers' durable equipment, appeared to have picked up in recent months from an already rapid pace earlier in the year. Nonetheless, business firms were expected to trim the growth in their outlays for equipment as forecasts of moderating expansion in aggregate demand materialized. Such a cutback would be abetted to an extent by the somewhat higher levels of market interest rates that business borrowers now faced. While growth in spending for high-technology equipment and related products probably would remain rapid in light of the accelerated pace of innovations and declining prices for such equipment, a significant deceleration or slowdown in spending for other types of capital equipment seemed likely under projected economic conditions, especially given currently reduced rates of capacity utilization in many manufacturing industries. In the nonresidential construction sector, business expenditures were expected to remain near current levels, reflecting ongoing strength in many parts of the country but also some signs of overbuilding in other areas.
