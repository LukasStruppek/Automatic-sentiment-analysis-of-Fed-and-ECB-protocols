absence of an appreciable moderation in overall demands, very tight labor markets would at some point foster significantly faster increases in labor compensation that could no longer be offset by stronger productivity growth. Indeed, at recent rates of increase in output, labor utilization was likely to continue to rise, adding to pressures on costs. The higher labor cost increases would in turn generate more rapid price inflation. Members noted in this regard that the trend in average hourly earnings appeared to have tilted up in recent months. While this relatively recent development was not yet conclusive evidence of accelerating labor costs, especially without further information about productivity, anecdotal reports of faster increases in labor compensation also appeared to have multiplied. In addition, improving economic conditions abroad, among other factors, had induced a firming in oil and other commodity prices, and had supported the foreign exchange value of other currencies relative to the dollar. As a consequence, the declines in commodity and other import prices that had helped to suppress inflation and inflation expectations over the last two years were not likely to be repeated. Members acknowledged that the prospects for rising inflation, including the potential timing of an acceleration, if any, remained uncertain, given the questions surrounding both the ongoing strength of aggregate demand and the outlook for productivity, but they viewed the risks of added price pressures as having risen further.
