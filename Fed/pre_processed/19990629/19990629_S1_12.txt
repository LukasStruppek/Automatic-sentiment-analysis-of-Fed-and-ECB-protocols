The consumer price index was unchanged in May following a sizable increase in April that was associated in part with a jump in energy prices. Excluding the effects of movements in food and energy prices, though, consumer inflation was a little higher in the April-May period than in the first quarter; for the twelve months ended in May, core consumer prices rose slightly less than in the previous twelve-month period. Producer prices of finished goods also were affected by the volatility of energy prices in April and May, but core producer prices recorded only a small rise in each month. However, for the twelve months ended in May, core producer inflation was up noticeably compared with the year-earlier period, owing in important part to sharp increases in the prices of tobacco products. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings grew a little faster in May than in April, but they rose less in the twelve months ended in May than in the previous twelve-month period.
