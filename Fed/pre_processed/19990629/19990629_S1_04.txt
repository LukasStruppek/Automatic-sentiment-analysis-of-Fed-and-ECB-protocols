The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity continued to expand vigorously, though at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year. Consumer outlays and construction spending had decelerated somewhat after growing very rapidly in the first quarter, but the deceleration had been partly offset by a step-up in business purchases of durable equipment and a smaller decline in net exports. Labor markets remained very tight, and recent wage and price increases had been a little larger on balance; nonetheless, longer-term inflation trends continued generally favorable in an environment of robust improvements in productivity.
