inflation. He noted that most measures of current inflation remain low, and he saw few signs of inflation in the pipeline. Conditions that called for a preemptive tightening in 1994--rapidly rising commodity prices and real short-term interest rates near zero--are not present today. While money growth has been rapid by historical standards, market-based indicators of monetary policy suggest sufficient restraint. Except for oil, most sensitive commodity prices have risen only slightly after years of decline, the dollar remains strong, real short-term interest rates are near historical norms, and productivity growth has accelerated in recent quarters. Mr. McTeer does not believe that rapid growth based on new technology, rising productivity, and other supply-side factors is inflationary, especially in the current global environment. He would have preferred to continue to test the growth limits of the new economy.
