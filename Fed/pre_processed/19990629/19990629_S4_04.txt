A number of recent indicators suggested that on a seasonally adjusted basis residential building activity had slowed a bit in the second quarter from an elevated level earlier in the year. However, homebuilding apparently was held back to some extent recently by scarcities of labor and some building supplies, and sizable backlogs evidently had built up. Looking ahead, the members expected residential construction expenditures to hold near current levels in the second half of this year as backlogs were worked lower, but they anticipated some softening subsequently. Factors bearing on this outlook included the large additions to the stock of housing in recent years and to some extent the backup that had occurred in mortgage rates. At some point the higher financing costs would begin to show through to housing demand.
