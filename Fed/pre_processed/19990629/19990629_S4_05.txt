The available information indicated that U.S. exports of goods and services had declined on balance thus far this year, while imports had posted very strong gains in line with continuing strength in U.S. domestic spending. However, improving economies in a number of the nation's important trading partners and the slower expansion forecast for the U.S. economy were expected to have a favorable effect on exports and to moderate increases in imports over the next several quarters. Indeed, recent data suggested that U.S. exports had advanced slightly after posting sizable declines during the first quarter while imports had continued to grow strongly. On net, the members anticipated that the nation's trade balance would continue to worsen, although more slowly and with a less negative effect on the U.S. economy over the forecast period.
