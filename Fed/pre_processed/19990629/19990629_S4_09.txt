All the members favored retaining the current ranges for this year and extending them on a provisional basis to 2000. The members recognized that the growth of both M2 and M3, while decelerating markedly from 1998, might still exceed the ranges for the current year and be near the upper ends of the ranges in 2000, assuming economic and financial conditions approximating their current expectations. However, as had been the case for many years, the members remained concerned that forecasts of money growth were still subject to a wide range of error in terms of the anticipated relationships between money growth and aggregate economic performance. Accordingly, they agreed that those ranges should not reflect or be centered on forecasts of money growth under projected economic and financial conditions, but should be regarded as anchors or benchmarks for money growth that would be associated with approximate price stability and sustained economic expansion, assuming behavior of velocity in line with historical experience. A reaffirmation of those ranges for 1999 and their extension to 2000 would therefore underscore the Committee's commitment to achieving and maintaining price stability over time and thereby fostering maximum sustainable economic growth. It was noted during this discussion that the apparent pickup in productivity, if it persisted, suggested that somewhat higher ranges than those adopted in recent years might more accurately reflect money growth under conditions of price stability and historically typical velocity trends. However, the members agreed that the marked degree of uncertainty in the outlook for productivity as well as velocity argued against any increases in the ranges at this point.
