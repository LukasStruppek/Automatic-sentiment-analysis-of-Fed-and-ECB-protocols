The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened somewhat in April from its first-quarter average. The value of exports increased slightly from its first-quarter average, primarily reflecting greater exports of computers and semiconductors, motor vehicles, and industrial supplies. The value of imports rose somewhat more, principally owing to larger imports of oil. The available information suggested that economic activity had picked up somewhat on balance in the major foreign industrial countries. The Japanese economy was reported to have expanded markedly in the first quarter, recording its first quarterly rise in the past year and a half. In Europe, economic growth rebounded in Germany but slowed somewhat in France and the United Kingdom. Signs of an improved economic performance also were evident in Latin America and Southeast Asia.
