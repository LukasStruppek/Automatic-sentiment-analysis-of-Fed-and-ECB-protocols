The Committee members were unanimously in favor of retaining the current range of 3 to 7 percent for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt in 1999 and extending that range on a provisional basis to 2000. They took account of a staff projection indicating that growth of the debt aggregate was likely to be around the middle of this range, perhaps somewhat above in 1999 and somewhat below in 2000. Unlike the ranges for the monetary aggregates, selection of the range for debt did not reflect a price stability and sustainable economic growth rationale but was based on forecasts of actual growth in this measure.
