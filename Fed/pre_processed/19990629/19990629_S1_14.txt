Open market operations were directed throughout the intermeeting period toward maintaining the federal funds rate at around 4-3/4 percent, and the average rate for the period was very close to the Committee's target. Other interest rates rose somewhat over the period since the May meeting in response to the combined effects of the Committee's announcement of an asymmetric directive, economic data that generally were stronger than expected, and reported comments of Federal Reserve officials. With the market effects of higher interest rates roughly offset by brighter second-quarter earnings prospects, broad indexes of share prices in equity markets changed little on balance over the intermeeting period.
