The members were divided over whether to retain the current asymmetrical directive tilted toward restraint or to adopt a symmetrical directive in conjunction with the contemplated tightening action. A majority endorsed a proposal to shift to a symmetrical directive. They agreed that following today's limited policy move the risks would still remain tilted toward rising inflation, and they expected that the announcement of a change in policy shortly after the meeting would include a reference to the Committee's ongoing concerns in that regard. But in light of the marked degree of uncertainty relating to the extent and timing of prospective inflationary pressures, they believed that further firming of policy might not be necessary in the near term and in any case would depend importantly on future developments. Some of these members were concerned that retention of asymmetry might be interpreted as an indication that the Committee was relatively certain that it would need to take further tightening action fairly soon, a view that tended to be reinforced by the behavior of expectations in the period after the announcement of a shift to asymmetry at the May meeting.
