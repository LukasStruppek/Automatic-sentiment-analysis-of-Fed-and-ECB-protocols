Members commented that inflation as reflected in a wide range of statistical measures and anecdotal reports remained remarkably subdued despite the persisting strength of the expansion and very tight labor markets across the nation. It seemed likely that rising productivity, which appeared to have accelerated markedly of late, accounted for much of the surprising combination of rapid growth in economic activity and low inflation. In particular, accelerating labor productivity clearly had curbed the rise in unit labor costs and damped pressures on prices. Very recent data on underlying productivity trends were not yet available, but the fact that profit forecasts had continued to be marked up suggested that it might still be accelerating and holding down costs. Such increases in productivity along with slack in foreign economies contributed to the very strong competition in most markets that was continuing generally to suppress efforts to raise prices. Other factors constraining inflation cited by the members included the ample availability of capacity in most industries and the declines that had occurred in non-oil import prices. Despite these favorable developments, most members had become increasingly worried about the risks of an overheating economy and rising inflation over time.
