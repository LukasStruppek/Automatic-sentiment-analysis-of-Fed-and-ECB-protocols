In keeping with the practice at meetings just before the Federal Reserve's semiannual monetary policy report to the Congress and the Chairman's associated testimony, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had provided individual projections of the growth in nominal and real GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 1999 and 2000. With regard to the growth of nominal GDP, most of the forecasts were in ranges of 5 to 5-1/2 percent for 1999 as a whole and 4 to 5 percent for 2000. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP for 1999 had a central tendency of 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent and for 2000 they were centered on a range of 2-1/2 to 3 percent, below the increases experienced over the last three years. The civilian rate of unemployment associated with these forecasts had central tendencies of 4 to 4-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999 and 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2000. Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, pointed to an appreciable increase in 1999, largely reflecting a swing in the price of energy, and little further change in 2000; specifically, the projections converged on CPI inflation rates of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent in 1999 and 2 to 2-1/2 percent in 2000. The members anticipated that the effects of the century date change on economic activity would, on balance, be limited or negligible over the forecast period, possibly adding somewhat to growth later this year and temporarily reducing growth early next year.
