In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the major foreign currencies dropped somewhat over the intermeeting period. The dollar's decline against the major foreign currencies occurred as questions about the strength of U.S. economic recovery and corporate earnings and the related lowering of expectations for near-term monetary tightening led to concerns that net foreign capital inflows might not be consistent with a stable exchange value for the dollar in the context of growing U.S. net international indebtedness. By contrast, the dollar rose slightly on average in terms of an index of the currencies of other important trading partners, notably the currencies of several Latin American countries that were experiencing political and economic problems.
