The discussion of the inflation outlook was held against the backdrop of an earlier consideration at this meeting of the factors behind the decline in inflation in the 1990s and the value of structural models for forecasting inflation. Most Committee members, while acknowledging the deficiencies of structural models, viewed them as useful in their efforts to understand how the inflation process was changing and also as input to inflation forecasts. The members saw greater productivity growth, changing labor markets, and increased competition in product markets as having played a part along with monetary policy in lowering inflation. They agreed that more research--across countries as well as across time--was needed before they could become more confident about the value and stability of such models.
