With imbalances in inventories apparently largely worked off and the contribution of inventory investment to the expansion likely diminishing in coming quarters, final demand would play its usual primary role in determining the strength of the expansion. In that regard, consumer spending was seen as likely to provide some continuing, though moderate, impetus to the growth of the economy. A favorable factor in this outlook cited by members was the ability and willingness of households to extract sizable financing resources for consumer and other expenditures by drawing on the appreciated equity in their homes in one form or another. The ample availability of credit to most consumers was another positive factor. Although consumer confidence as measured by national surveys recently had declined somewhat from relatively elevated levels, reports of strength in motor vehicle sales and in other retail sales in several parts of the nation in recent weeks suggested that consumer spending was continuing to be well maintained. The members recognized that a typical recovery-period surge in consumer spending was unlikely inasmuch as expenditures had registered solid growth through the economic downturn, implying an absence of significant pent-up demands. Moreover, forecasts of even moderate growth in spending were subject to downside risks emanating, for example, from possible further shocks to confidence and household wealth should weakness in stock prices persist, and from political turmoil overseas and threats of terrorism at home.
