[' Shipments of nondefense capital goods recorded another strong advance in February. Shipments of office and computing equipment rebounded in February from declines in December and January, and demand for most other types of equipment remained brisk. Business outlays for heavy trucks fell back slightly in February after a surge in January. While there were tentative signs in the recent orders data of some deceleration in business equipment spending, the still-growing backlog of unfilled orders suggested further solid expansion in business spending on equipment. Nonresidential construction activity had been trending appreciably higher over the past two years; however, a slowdown in spending by public utilities in December and January, in an environment of uncertainty related to pending deregulation, and a third straight monthly decline in permit issuance for nonresidential structures in February pointed to some softening in the uptrend.
