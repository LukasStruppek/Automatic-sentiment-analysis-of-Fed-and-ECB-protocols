[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened sharply in January from its December level and its average rate in the fourth quarter; some of the increase in the deficit was due to trade with Mexico, but somewhat distorted seasonal adjustment factors also may have been involved. The value of exports of goods and services declined substantially in January after having increased strongly in November and December. The value of imports rose considerably in January, continuing the pattern of the fourth quarter. The export losses and import gains in January were distributed widely across major trade categories. The pace of economic recovery in the major foreign industrial countries appeared to have moderated in recent months. In the fourth quarter, economic activity declined in Japan and grew more slowly in most of the other major industrial countries; growth had picked up in Canada. Available data suggested that in the first quarter economic expansion had slowed in all of the major foreign industrial countries except Japan, where growth appeared to be positive despite the Kobe earthquake.
