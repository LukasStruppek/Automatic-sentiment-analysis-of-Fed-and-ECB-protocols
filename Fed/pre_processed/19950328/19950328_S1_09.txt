[' Business inventory investment surged in January after a slowdown in December; excluding a large increase in stocks of motor vehicles at the wholesale and retail levels, inventories rose in January at about the average rate of the final three quarters of 1994. In manufacturing, inventory accumulation outpaced sales in January; the stocks-to-sales ratio edged higher but was still near historical lows. At wholesale establishments, inventory accumulation picked up in January as a large rise in automotive inventories more than offset a reduced increase in stocks of other goods. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the sector moved higher in January but remained well within its range of the last several years. At the retail level, inventories jumped in January after a slight decline in December; almost all the rise reflected increased stocks of motor vehicles. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector as a whole was unchanged in January and remained near the middle of its range of recent years, at automotive dealerships, the inventory-to-sales ratio rose sharply while elsewhere the ratio edged lower.
