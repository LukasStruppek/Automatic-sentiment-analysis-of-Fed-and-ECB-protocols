[" In the course of the Committee's discussion, members reported on widespread signs that business activity, while still quite strong in many areas, was growing less rapidly on balance. Still, a number of factors pointed to continued solid expansion. Business sentiment was generally described as quite positive, though somewhat less ebullient than in earlier months. Likewise, recent surveys suggested that consumer confidence remained very favorable, though down slightly from recent peaks by most measures. In addition to the favorable recent developments in financial markets, bank lending policies remained quite accommodative, although business loan growth had slowed recently after a period of unusual strength.
