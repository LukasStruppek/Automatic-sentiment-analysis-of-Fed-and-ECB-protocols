[' Committee members anticipated that growth of business investment in plant and equipment would moderate from the extraordinary rate of the last two years but that such investment would continue to support growth in aggregate final demand during the forecast period. The demand for durable equipment was expected to increase more gradually as the growth of economic activity slowed and business profits tended to flatten out, and the available data on equipment expenditures thus far in 1995 appeared to be in line with that expectation. However, some anecdotal reports suggested that investment in plant and equipment might be stronger than expected in an environment of tight labor supply and elevated levels of capacity utilization, intense desires to control costs and improve competitiveness, and a still relatively low user cost of capital. The desire for additional production capacity was reflected in spending for the construction of commercial and industrial structures, which remained on an uptrend. ']
