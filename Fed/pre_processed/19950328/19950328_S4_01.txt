[" In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. The policy tightening that had been implemented since early 1994 appeared to be exerting a desired restraining effect on the growth of economic activity and associated demands for goods and services. But the extent of the slowing in growth and its effects on inflationary pressures were not yet clear. On balance, though, the available evidence tended to suggest that the economy might be moving toward a growth path for economic activity that would be consistent with limiting the uptick in inflation that was currently being experienced. In discussing their policy choices, several members noted the relatively steep decline in the value of the dollar. However, they believed that policy should not be directed toward the achievement of a specific level for the dollar but rather toward the implementation of an effective anti-inflationary monetary policy, taking account of all the factors bearing on the economic outlook. In current circumstances, and given the substantial uncertainties that were involved, the members believed that it would be prudent to pause and assess developments before taking any further policy action.
