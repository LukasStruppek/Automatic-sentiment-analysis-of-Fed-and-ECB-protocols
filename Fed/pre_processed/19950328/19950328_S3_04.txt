[' The housing market had weakened noticeably according to incoming data and anecdotal reports from around the country. The decline in home sales that began in the latter part of 1994 had persisted, and housing starts had fallen sharply in the early part of the year as a consequence of the weaker sales and a larger inventory of unsold homes. Partly because of the higher mortgage rates that had prevailed for some time, members anticipated still soft housing demand, particularly for single-family houses. There had been some reports that recent declines in mortgage interest rates were having a mitigating effect. In some parts of the country, the weakness in housing construction was being countered by further improvement in nonresidential construction activity. In other areas where commercial real estate conditions remained soft, declines in vacancy rates seemed to be preparing the way for a pickup in commercial building activity. ']
