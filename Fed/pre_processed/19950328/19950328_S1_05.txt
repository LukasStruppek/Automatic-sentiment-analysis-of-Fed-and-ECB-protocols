[' Nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably over January and February, although the average monthly advance was somewhat smaller than that of 1994. Further brisk job gains were recorded in the January-February period in manufacturing; hiring in retail and wholesale trade and in the service-producing sector slowed a bit; and construction payrolls changed little on balance. The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers remained at a high level over the two months. The civilian unemployment rate rose in January but fell back in February to its December level of 5.4 percent. ']
