[' Consumer price inflation remained subdued in September. The increase in both overall consumer prices and the prices of consumer items other than food and energy was modest. For the twelve months ended in September, prices of consumer items other than food and energy increased by a considerably smaller amount than in the year- earlier period. At the producer level, the September rise in prices was the largest monthly increment since January 1991; nonetheless, the overall index was unchanged over the past twelve months after a sizable rise over the previous twelve-month period. The core index also decelerated on a year-over-year basis. The rate of increase in the hourly compensation of private industry workers was unchanged in the third quarter, but the advance over the past four quarters was somewhat larger than that for the previous four. Growth in average hourly earnings picked up in September and October, perhaps partly reflecting the effects of an increase in the federal minimum wage. ']
