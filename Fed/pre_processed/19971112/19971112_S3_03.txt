[' In the course of their discussion, the members gave consider- able emphasis to recent developments in labor markets. Statistical indicators of rising levels of employment, low and falling rates of unemployment, and a diminishing supply of new workers were reinforced by anecdotal evidence of tight labor markets throughout the nation. The demand for many types of workers exceeded the supply in many regions, and a number of members reported that growth of economic activity in various parts of the country was being held back by the scarcity of labor. While labor compensation had accelerated, the pickup was moderate in light of the taut conditions in labor markets and some of it reflected the legislated rise in the minimum wage. Nonetheless, members cited numerous examples of efforts to attract or retain workers in especially scarce supply through a variety of bonus payments and other incentives that were not included in standard measures of labor compensation.
