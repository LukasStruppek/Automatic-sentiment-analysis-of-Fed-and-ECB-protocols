[' Business inventory investment appeared to have moderated substantially in the third quarter from the rapid rate of the previous quarter, and on balance stocks were at relatively low levels in relation to sales. In manufacturing, stocks rose somewhat further in September, but the inventory-to-shipments ratio for the sector declined to the low end of its range for the past twelve months. Wholesale inventories posted another sizable advance in September; the inventory-sales ratio for this sector was just above the high end of its range for the past year. Retail stocks fell in August (latest available data), more than reversing their July increase. The inventory-sales ratio for the sector also was at the low end of its range for the past year. ']
