[" Open market operations were directed throughout the inter- meeting period toward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with the Committee's intended level of around 5-1/2 percent for the federal funds rate, and the rate averaged close to that level over the period. Other financial markets became quite volatile from time to time. Share prices in equity markets fluctuated widely in occasionally turbulent trading activity and were down somewhat on balance over the period; equity markets in other countries, notably in Asia, also were volatile, and very large declines were recorded in some of those markets. Against this background, U.S. short-term interest rates registered small mixed changes over the period since the September 30 meeting, while Treasury bond yields declined somewhat on balance. Unexpectedly strong incoming data on U.S. producer prices, employment, and wages tended to exert upward pressures on bond yields on some days, but these were more than offset by investor desires for safety and quality, the continuing moderation in consumer inflation, and the perception engendered by international financial developments that inflation pressures were likely to remain subdued.
