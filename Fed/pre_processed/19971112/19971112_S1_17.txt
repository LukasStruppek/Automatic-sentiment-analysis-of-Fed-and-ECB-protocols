[" Growth of M2 and M3 apparently moderated further in October, though the expansion of these aggregates remained brisk. A sharp slowing of inflows to money market mutual funds accounted for much of the deceleration of M2, and an easing in the pace of issuance of large time deposits, evidently reflecting a smaller rise in bank credit, also contributed to a modest reduction in M3 growth. For the year through October, M2 expanded at a rate that was at the upper bound of the Committee's range for the year and M3 at a rate substantially above the upper bound of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt increased in recent months at a rate somewhat below the middle of its range. "]
