[' The trend in productivity gains was a key factor in the outlook for unit costs and ultimately for price inflation. As had been true for an extended period, inflation had remained relatively subdued in comparison with past experience under broadly similar economic conditions. The reasons for the relative quiescence of inflation were not fully understood, but they undoubtedly included a number of special factors beyond higher productivity such as a lagged response to earlier appreciation of the dollar and unusually damped increases in the cost of health benefits. As they had at previous meetings, members suggested that these favorable influences were likely to erode over the year ahead. A number of members again cited reports of increases in health insurance premiums next year and subsequently. More fundamentally, it was difficult to predict whether anticipated increases in labor compensation would be fully offset by productivity gains in coming quarters and whether, in turn, competitive market conditions would allow firms to raise prices to compensate for any increases in their costs. On balance, the members felt that the risks remained in the direction of rising price inflation though the extent and timing of that outcome were subject to considerable debate. ']
