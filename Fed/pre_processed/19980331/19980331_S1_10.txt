[' Consumer prices were little changed on balance in January and February, as substantial declines in energy prices largely offset increases elsewhere. Excluding food and energy items, consumer price inflation picked up somewhat in the first two months of the year from the pace of the second half of 1997; on a year-over-year basis, however, the increase in consumer prices during the twelve months ended in February was slightly smaller than that in the year-earlier period. At the producer level, falling prices for finished energy goods in January and February pulled down the index of prices for all finished items; excluding food and energy, prices were unchanged on balance over the two months. Over the twelve months ended in February, producer price inflation was negligible. Tight labor markets appeared to be putting some upward pressure on labor compensation, but the pickup was limited. The change in average hourly earnings over the twelve months ended in February was only slightly larger than the increase over the year-earlier period. ']
