[' The available information for February and part of March indicated that M2 and M3 expanded more rapidly than the Committee had anticipated at the time of its February meeting. On a quarterly average basis, growth of both monetary aggregates picked up somewhat in the first quarter from already robust rates in the fourth quarter. The increased demand for M2 was perhaps associated in part with the reduced attractiveness of longer-term fixed rate market assets, whose yields had declined significantly relative to the returns on liquid investment components of M2. In addition, households might have been trying to rebalance asset portfolios that had become more heavily weighted in equities as a result of the run-up in stock prices. The pickup in M3 growth reflected a surge in bank issuance of large time deposits to finance strong demands for loans by businesses and households. The expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt also strengthened over recent months in response to heavy private demands for credit. ']
