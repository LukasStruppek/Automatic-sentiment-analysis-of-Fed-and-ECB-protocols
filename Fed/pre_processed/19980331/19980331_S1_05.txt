[' Industrial production edged up on balance in January and February after having increased rapidly in the second half of 1997. Part of the deceleration stemmed from the depressing effect of unusually warm winter weather on the provision of heating services by utilities. The growth of manufacturing production also slowed considerably as a result of downward adjustments to assemblies of motor vehicles and, more generally, weakness in the output of business equipment. With investment in new manufacturing facilities still brisk and manufacturing output posting only a small advance in the January-February period, the factory operating rate eased a little. ']
