[' The second, foreign trade developments, also was likely to have a damping influence on the domestic economy. While the lagged effects of the dollars appreciation and economic conditions in key U.S. trading partners around the world were important factors in this assessment, members focused in this discussion on the effects of weakness in several Asian economies. Conditions in Japan and in key emerging market economies in Asia were still quite fragile, adjust- ments on the real side of the economy were just beginning to be felt in some cases, and outcomes for economic growth and exchange rates were still very much in doubt. Nonetheless, some progress had been made in putting recovery programs together and financial markets had seemed to stabilize in several countries. Anecdotal reports of adverse repercussions on individual U.S. firms from the Asian financial turmoil had increased somewhat since the Committees previous meeting, but the direct overall impact on the U.S. economy was still limited. Indeed, developments in Asia also appeared to have had positive, albeit indirect, effects on domestic demand and prices in the near term by exerting some downward pressure on U.S. interest rates and world oil prices. Prices in the United States of a number of Asian goods and of domestic products competing with those goods had been lowered. Over time, conditions in key Asian economies were thought likely to have a more pronounced retarding effect on the U.S. economy. While the eventual dimensions of that effect remained uncertain, a number of members commented that, on the basis of developments to date, they might turn out to be less negative than had been expected earlier, or at least that some "worst case" outcomes seemed less likely.
