Total real government purchases seemed to be flattening out, on balance, in the first quarter after rising solidly in the fourth quarter.

In contrast, real purchases by state and local governments looked to be rising, as the payrolls of these governments increased in January and February and nominal state and local construction spending advanced somewhat in January.
