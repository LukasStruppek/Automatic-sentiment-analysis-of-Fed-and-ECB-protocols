[' The prospects for business capital spending remained a sup- portive element in the outlook for further economic expansion, but growth in such spending was expected to slow considerably from its rapid pace over the past few years. The ready availability and fairly low cost of business finance in equity and debt markets and the continuing commitment of business firms to modernizing their facilities to hold down costs in highly competitive markets would tend to support growth in business fixed investment. Profits and cash flows were expected to remain reasonably strong, though there were tentative signs of some softening in profit margins. On the other hand, the longevity of the current expansion had resulted in the addition of a good deal of production capacity in recent years. This development in conjunction with some decline in capacity utilization over the past several quarters pointed to less need for expansion in plant and equipment. The rise in outlays for computers and related products was likely to remain fairly robust in light of the continuing advances in technology and the marked downtrend in computer prices, but the growth of computer expenditures was projected to be well below the extraordinary pace of the past few years. The slowdown would reflect factors that were expected to damp the growth of overall business investment spending and a greater saturation of potential computer markets that might lead to more emphasis on replacement demand rather than the further expansion of capacity.
