[' Nominal retail sales increased briskly in February after having registered little change in January. The February spurt was paced by strong motor vehicle purchases, but spending at general merchandise stores and apparel outlets also was up considerably after a weak performance in previous months. Sales at durable goods stores were less robust, rising only slightly in February. Recent indicators of housing demand and activity were generally favorable. Starts of both single-family and multifamily units moved higher on balance over January and February, and sales of new homes increased appreciably in January (latest data available). By contrast, sales of existing homes declined in January for a fourth consecutive month. ']
