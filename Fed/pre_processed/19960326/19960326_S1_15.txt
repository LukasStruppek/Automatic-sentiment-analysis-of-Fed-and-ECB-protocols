[" Growth of the broader monetary aggregates strengthened considerably in February and early March following the decline in short-term interest rates in late 1995 and early 1996. The acceleration of M2 reflected a surge in demand deposits as well as larger inflows to retail money market mutual funds, whose yields tend to adjust with a lag to changes in short-term market interest rates. Larger inflows to institution-only money market funds contributed to M3's stronger performance. Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt slowed somewhat in December and January, reflecting reduced federal government borrowing, but remained moderate on balance. "]
