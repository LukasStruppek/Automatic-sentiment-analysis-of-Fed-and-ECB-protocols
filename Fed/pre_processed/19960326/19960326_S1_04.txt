[" Much of the information reviewed at this meeting had been influenced to an uncertain degree by unusually severe winter weather, industrial strikes, and U.S. government shutdowns. On balance, however, growth of economic activity appeared to have picked up after having slowed appreciably in late 1995. Growth in consumer spending seemed to have resumed at a moderate rate in the wake of January's storms; business spending on durable equipment was recording further healthy gains; and housing demand was showing some signs of strengthening. With businesses making considerable progress in getting their inventories under control, industrial production and employment had rebounded briskly. The recent data on prices gave little indication of any change in underlying inflation trends. "]
