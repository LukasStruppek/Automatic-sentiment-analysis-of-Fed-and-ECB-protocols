[' The members did not differ greatly in their assessments of the most probable course of inflation. Their expectations ranged from essentially unchanged to slightly higher inflation in comparison with 1995. At the same time, members expressed somewhat differing views about possible deviations of inflation from their expectations. Those who emphasized the risks of higher-than-projected inflation tended to cite the potential for increasing wage and price pressures in an economy that already was operating at or close to its estimated capacity. Increases in labor costs had been unusually subdued in light of the relatively low unemployment nationwide and widespread anecdotal reports of labor shortages. In this view the rise in labor costs could well accelerate at some point, though not necessarily in the near term, with some feedthrough to prices. Other developments that generated some concern about the outlook for inflation included the rise in the costs of medical benefits in the fourth quarter, price pressures in the energy and food sectors of the economy, and the possibility that the recent rise in intermediate- and long-term interest rates might to some extent reflect worsening inflationary expectations. Other members saw only a limited risk of higher inflation, and a few indicated that they did not rule out some reduction in consumer price inflation from that experienced in 1995. In this view there was sufficient capacity in the economy to allow room for moderate growth of economic activity in line with their forecasts without fostering added inflation. Moreover, there was only scattered evidence of accelerating increases in worker compensation associated with labor shortages and little indication that possibly diminishing worries about job security would induce rising labor militancy. Some members also stressed the persistence of strong competition in numerous markets that tended to preclude or restrain raising prices. ']
