[' Inflation trends had remained stable in recent months. At the consumer level, food prices continued to edge up in February and energy prices again were under appreciable upward pressure. Excluding the often-volatile food and energy items, consumer prices advanced in February at a slightly slower rate than in January; and for the twelve months ended in February, consumer prices rose a little less than in the comparable year-earlier period. At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy were unchanged on balance over January and February; the rise in this measure of prices over the twelve months ended in February was somewhat larger than in the comparable year-earlier interval. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers edged down in February after a considerable increase in January. However, for the twelve-month period ended in February, average hourly earnings rose more than in the year-earlier period. ']
