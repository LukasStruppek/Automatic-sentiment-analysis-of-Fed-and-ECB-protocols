[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services in December (latest data available) was little changed from its November level. On a quarterly-average basis, however, the deficit in the fourth quarter was substantially smaller than it had been in the third quarter. The value of exports of goods and services rose appreciably in the fourth quarter, with the largest increases occurring in machinery exports and foreign tourist services. The value of imports declined slightly, largely as a result of decreases in imports of automotive products, consumer goods, and oil. The data available on economic conditions in the major foreign industrial countries in early 1996 suggested that a moderate recovery was under way in Japan, and there were some signs of a pickup in activity in much of Western Europe, although the German economy remained weak.
