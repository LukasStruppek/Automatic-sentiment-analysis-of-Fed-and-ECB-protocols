[" A surge in nonfarm payroll employment in February considerably more than offset a large weather-related drop in January. Very large job gains were recorded in February in the construction, retail trade, and services industries; however, some of these increases reflected the reversal of the depressing effects of January's severe winter storms and the efforts of some firms to make up for associated production losses. A small rise in manufacturing employment in February only partially offset a further loss of factory jobs in January. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent in February. "]
