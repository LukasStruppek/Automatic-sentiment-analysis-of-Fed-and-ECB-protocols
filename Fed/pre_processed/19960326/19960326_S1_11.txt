[" At its meeting on January 30-31, 1996, the Committee adopted a directive that called for a slight reduction in the degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible reduction of 1/4 percentage point in the discount rate. The directive approved by the Committee did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, should unanticipated developments warrant a policy change. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months. "]
