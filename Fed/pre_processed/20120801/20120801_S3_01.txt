 In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received since the Committee met in June suggested that economic activity had decelerated in recent months to a slower pace than they had anticipated Although business investment had continued to advance, consumer spending had slowed considerably since earlier in the year Conditions in the housing sector appeared to have improved somewhat, but from a very low level Indicators of manufacturing activity had softened Recent monthly gains in payroll employment had continued to be small, and the unemployment rate in June remained at an elevated level Consumer price inflation had been low in recent months, as declines in the costs of crude oil were passed through to retail energy prices Longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable Regarding the economic outlook, most participants agreed that economic growth was likely to remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up gradually However, some participants indicated that they had lowered their near-term forecasts for economic growth in light of the weaker-than-expected increases in consumer spending and employment in recent months In addition, some participants expressed concern about the persistent headwinds restraining the pace of the recovery, including the weak housing sector, still-tight borrowing conditions for some households and firms, and fiscal restraint at all levels of government Many participants judged that a high level of uncertainty about possible spillovers from the fiscal and banking strains in the euro area and about the outlook for US fiscal or regulatory policies was holding back household and business spending Â And they saw the possibilities of an intensification of strains in the euro area and of a sharper-than-anticipated US fiscal consolidation as significant downside risks to the economic outlook Although participants generally agreed that improvements in recent years in the capital and liquidity of financial institutions and in the strength of household and business balance sheets have increased the resilience of the economy, some were concerned that at its current pace, the recovery was still vulnerable to adverse shocks Given participants' forecasts of economic activity, they generally anticipated that the unemployment rate would decline only slowly toward levels that participants judge to be consistent with the Committee's mandate Participants' assessments of the outlook for inflation were largely unchanged from those reported in June Smoothing through the effects of fluctuations in food and energy prices, participants anticipated that inflation over the medium term would remain at or below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective Meeting participants again exchanged views on the extent of slack in labor and product markets A number of participants expressed the view that structural changes in the labor market were not sufficient to explain the high level of unemployment Those participants saw substantial slack in resource utilization and hence continued to judge that inflation was likely to remain subdued over the medium term as the economy continued to recover However, several other participants interpreted the moderate pace of the recovery as pointing to a more substantial markdown in the trajectory of potential output In particular, a couple of participants noted that they would have expected inflation to have fallen more in recent years if the output gap had been as substantial as some measures suggested One participant posited that the sharp decline in net worth and reduced credit availability in recent years not only weighed on aggregate demand, but also reduced aggregate supply by hampering new business formation and product innovation; another participant cited evidence that structural unemployment was elevated as a result of mismatches between the skills demanded by employers and those of the long-duration unemployed
