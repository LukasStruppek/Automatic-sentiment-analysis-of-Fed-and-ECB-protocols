Most interest rates have increased appreciably since the Committee meeting on October 6. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose very substantially over the intermeeting period. M2 has expanded at a moderate pace since mid summer, with all of its growth stemming from its Ml component, while M3 grew slowly. Through October, both aggregates were estimated to have grown at rates a little below the lower ends of the ranges established by the Committee for the year.
