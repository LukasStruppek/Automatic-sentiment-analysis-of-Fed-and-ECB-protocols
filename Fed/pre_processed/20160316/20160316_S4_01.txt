 In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in January suggested that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months They also agreed that household spending had been increasing at a moderate rate, and that the housing sector had improved further; however, business fixed investment and net exports had been soft Members saw a range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, as pointing to additional strengthening of the labor market Members noted that inflation had picked up in recent months; however, they also noted that inflation had continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months
