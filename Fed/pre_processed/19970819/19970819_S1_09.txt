[' Nonfarm business inventories increased rapidly in the second quarter, but there were few signs of inventory imbalances. In June, the pace of inventory investment in manufacturing slowed from the rapid average rate for April and May, and the inventory-shipments ratio for the sector was at a very low level. In wholesale trade, stocks rose sharply in June after little net change over the two previous months. Despite the June increase, the stock-sales ratio was at the middle of its relatively narrow range of the past year. At the retail level, the rise in inventories in June retraced only part of the May decline; the inventory-sales ratio for the sector also was near the middle of its range for the last year. ']
