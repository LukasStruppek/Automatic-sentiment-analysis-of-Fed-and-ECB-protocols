[' Industrial production increased relatively slowly in July after having advanced at a fairly brisk pace over the first half of the year. The July slowdown reflected a temporary drop in motor vehicle assemblies partly associated with work stoppages at a major automotive manufacturer. Outside the motor vehicles sector, the output of business equipment and consumer durable goods rose strongly while the production of consumer nondurables weakened further. Factory capacity increased a little more than production in July, and the utilization of total manufacturing capacity slipped to its lowest level since last autumn. ']
