[' The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion of the economy would be damped in the second half of the year by a slowing of inventory accumulation from the unsustainably brisk pace in the first half of the year. In 1998, the economy would expand at a pace in line with the growth of its estimated potential. Growth of consumer spending, supported by high levels of household wealth and projected further gains in employment and income, was expected to be relatively brisk over the forecast horizon. Business spending on equipment and structures was anticipated to continue to outpace the overall expansion of the economy, though the differential would tend to narrow over time in association with the gradual diminution of increases in sales and profits that was expected in conjunction with moderating economic growth. Housing construction was projected to drift lower over the forecast horizon. The staff anticipated that the external sector would exert some mild restraint on the expansion of economic activity. With labor compensation gradually accelerating in the context of higher resource utilization, core consumer price inflation was forecast to drift slightly higher. ']
