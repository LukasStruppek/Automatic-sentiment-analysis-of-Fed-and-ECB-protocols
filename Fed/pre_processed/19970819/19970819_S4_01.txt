[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. Underlying economic conditions and the outlook for economic activity and inflation had changed little in recent months. The most likely outcome of the current policy stance was growth near potential and some pickup in inflation as the effects of special factors holding it down abated. For the present, monetary policy appeared to be appropriately positioned to foster the Committee's objectives of resisting an intensification of inflationary pressures while supporting a fully employed economy. The level of real short-term interest rates was relatively high by historical standards and provided some assurance that the current stance of policy would not accommodate a significant increase in underlying inflationary pressures. Nonetheless, the members remained concerned about the outlook for inflation. Although some decline in inflation could not be ruled out, persistence of the current degree of tightness in labor markets, consistent with the economy growing at a pace near its potential, could at some point begin to put more pressure on costs and prices, and growth somewhat above potential, which some members saw as a distinct possibility, would be even more likely to produce that result. While there were no current indications that inflation might be accelerating and no policy move was called for at this time, the members saw a need for continuing vigilance. As at earlier meetings, a number of them expressed the view that an anticipatory policy move to counter intensifying inflationary pressures likely would be needed at some point. "]
