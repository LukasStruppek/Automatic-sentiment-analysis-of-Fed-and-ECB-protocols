[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding moderately. Growth in consumer spending had picked up after having slowed sharply in early spring, business purchases of durable equipment were still on a strong upward trend, and housing demand seemed to have been well maintained. The overall rise in production had been held down recently by supply disruptions in the motor vehicles industry, but employment had continued to expand at a strong pace and the unemployment rate was at a low level. Increases in labor compensation had remained moderate even though labor markets were tight, and price inflation was still subdued. ']
