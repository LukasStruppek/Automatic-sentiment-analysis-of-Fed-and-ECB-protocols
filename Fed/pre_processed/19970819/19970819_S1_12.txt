[' At its meeting on July 1-2, 1997, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Because the Committee continued to see a potential need for some tightening of monetary policy to counter rising inflationary pressures, the directive included a bias toward a possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The reserve market conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months. ']
