[" The members reviewed proposals for rewording the operational paragraph of the directive for the purpose of updating and clarifying the description of the Committee's instructions to the Manager of the System Open Market Account and to conform the directive wording with current public announcement practices regarding the Committee's policy decisions. In particular, the directive would in the future include specific reference to the federal funds rate that the Committee judged to be consistent with the stance of monetary policy. The Committee also modified the present sentence relating to the intermeeting bias in the directive to recognize that changes in the stance of policy are now expressed in terms of the federal funds rate. These changes were not intended to alter the substance of the directive or the Committee's operating procedures. "]
