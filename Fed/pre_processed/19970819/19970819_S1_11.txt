[' Consumer price inflation picked up slightly in July from the slow pace in each of the previous four months; a small decline in energy prices offset a further increase in food prices. The index for items other than food and energy rose in July at the same low rate recorded for both the first six months of 1997 and the twelve months ended in July. At the producer level, prices of finished goods edged down for a seventh consecutive month, reflecting a further drop in food prices. Prices of finished goods other than food and energy were unchanged over the twelve months ended in July. At earlier stages of production, producer prices for core intermediate materials rose slightly over the year ended in July and prices of core crude materials increased by a larger amount over the same period. Growth in hourly compensation of private industry workers picked up somewhat in the second quarter, but the rise in compensation over the year ended in June matched the advance over the comparable year-earlier period. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers were unchanged in July, and the rise in such earnings over the twelve months ended in July also was the same as in the year-earlier period.
