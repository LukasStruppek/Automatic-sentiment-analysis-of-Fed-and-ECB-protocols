[" In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose significantly on balance over the intermeeting period. The appreciation of the dollar was uneven against the currencies of the major foreign industrial countries. The dollar's substantial increase against the German mark and other continental European countries reflected both the continuing favorable developments in the U.S. economy and persisting market concerns that difficulties faced by the major European countries would lead to policies that might detract from strength in the euro. The dollar rose only slightly against the yen. That currency came under downward pressure in reaction to incoming data suggesting a somewhat- greater-than-expected falloff in demand following the recent increase in the consumption tax, but the release of the June current account surplus late in the intermeeting period rekindled market concerns about Japanese external balances and led to some appreciation of the yen.
