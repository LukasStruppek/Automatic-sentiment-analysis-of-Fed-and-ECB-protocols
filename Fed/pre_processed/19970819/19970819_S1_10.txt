[" The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was slightly smaller on balance over April and May than the downward-revised average rate in the first quarter. Measured against their first-quarter levels, the value of exported goods and services grew more than the value of imports over the April-May period. The largest increases in exports were in machinery and aircraft and parts, while the biggest gains in imports were in consumer goods, computers, and capital goods other than computers. The available information suggested that in recent months economic activity had expanded further in all the major foreign industrial countries except Japan. Growth continued to be robust in Canada and the United Kingdom and apparently remained moderate in France and Germany. Economic activity in Japan had slowed after a rise in that country's consumption tax in April. "]
