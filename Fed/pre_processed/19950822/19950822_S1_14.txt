[" Treasury yields declined across the maturity spectrum in response to the announcement of the easing action on July 6; market participants perceived the policy move as an indication of the Federal Reserve's concern regarding the state of the economy and, based on historical precedent, as likely the first in a series of easing steps. Subsequently, however, interest rates rebounded in response to incoming economic data that were seen as suggesting stronger economic performance and reduced chances for further monetary policy easing. On balance, short-term market interest rates posted mixed changes over the intermeeting period, while intermediate- and long-term rates rose appreciably. With unexpectedly favorable corporate earnings reports outweighing the effects of higher interest rates, major indexes of equity prices were up moderately on balance over the period. "]
