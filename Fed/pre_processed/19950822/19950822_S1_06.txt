[' Industrial production edged higher in July, but it was unchanged on balance over the three months ending in July after declining in earlier months. Manufacturing output fell further in July; a sharp contraction in the production of motor vehicles and parts accounted for the entire decline. Within manufacturing, output of business equipment other than motor vehicles continued to advance as additional strong gains were recorded in the production of office and computing equipment. The output of non-auto consumer goods weakened; a cutback in the production of home furnishings offset an increase in the manufacture of appliances. With capacity continuing to expand rapidly, total utilization of industrial capacity dropped somewhat further. ']
