[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, the members focused on recent indications of some strengthening in the expansion of economic activity after a period of limited growth during the spring. Further growth in final demand was generating an improvement in overall business activity, despite a more rapid adjustment in inventory investment than many had expected. This configuration suggested that the risks of recession or an extended period of subpar growth were now reduced, and sustained expansion at a moderate pace was seen as the most likely course for the economy. Although the risks to the economy now seemed to be more evenly balanced than at the time of the July meeting, they were still sizable in both directions. In particular, uncertainties about federal budget policies and their effects on the economy remained substantial. With respect to prices, members noted that the recent pause in the expansion had eased pressures on resources, and the economy appeared to be in a better position to accommodate moderate growth over the forecast horizon without adding to inflation. Indeed, some members were optimistic that growth of the economy at a pace in line with their expectations would be consistent with modest further decreases in inflation. Others expressed concern, however, that the uncertainties surrounding the outlook for the economy included questions about the persistence of inflationary sentiment and the prospects for further progress toward stable prices over the next several quarters.
