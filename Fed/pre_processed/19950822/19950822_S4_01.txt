[" Turning to monetary policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members accepted a proposal to maintain an unchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets and to adopt a directive that was not biased in either direction with regard to potential intermeeting adjustments. For the near term, current trends in economic activity and inflation appeared favorable and likely to remain so with an unchanged policy stance. A steady policy also seemed appropriate pending a clearer assessment of the outlook for fiscal policy. Over the longer term, the members generally believed that consideration would need to be given to an adjustment in the Committee's policy stance, especially if substantial fiscal restraint were to be enacted. The extent to which an adjustment might be needed later in the stance of monetary policy --characterized by some members as slightly to the restrictive side at least in terms of the inflation-adjusted federal funds rate --would have to be assessed in terms of its consistency with the Committee's continuing objectives of fostering price stability and promoting sustained economic growth.
