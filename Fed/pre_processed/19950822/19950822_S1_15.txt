[" In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies appreciated substantially over the intermeeting period. The dollar's gain occurred partly in response to the improving outlook for the U.S. economy and the related rise in long-term interest rates in the United States. Declines in long-term yields in the major European industrial countries probably contributed to a higher value of the dollar in terms of the German mark and most other European currencies. In addition, the dollar appreciated sharply against the Japanese yen, largely in response to actions by Japanese authorities to reduce official interest rates, to encourage capital outflows from Japan, and to make large intervention purchases of dollars during a period when the dollar already was rising against the yen.
