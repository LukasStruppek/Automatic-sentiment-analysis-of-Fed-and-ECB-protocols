[' Members generally viewed the near-term outlook for inflation as more encouraging than it had appeared to be earlier this year. The pause in the expansion during the spring had eased pressures on resources, as evidenced in part by anecdotal reports of lessening labor shortages in some areas and reduced use of overtime work by some firms, and the higher rate of inflation experienced during the early months of the year seemed unlikely to persist. The members differed somewhat, however, in their assessment of the longer-term outlook for inflation. Some emphasized the reduction that had occurred in inflationary pressures, and with labor costs remaining subdued they felt that economic growth in line with current forecasts should prove compatible with moderating inflation over time. Further, the recent appreciation of the dollar should contribute marginally to a more favorable inflation outcome after some lag. Other members expressed reservations about the prospects for an improved inflation performance over coming quarters. They cited indications of persisting inflationary expectations such as the recent weakness of the bond markets and survey results that pointed to expectations of some rise in inflation from current levels. They also referred to the possibility that favorable labor cost developments would not persist indefinitely in an economy that was operating in the vicinity of its potential. ']
