[' M2 and M3 continued to register sizable increases in July and appeared to be expanding considerably further in August. The recent strength of M2 seemed to reflect in part the relatively greater appeal of interest rates on M2 assets in the wake of the declines in market interest rates that had taken place this year, particularly at longer maturities. Robust M3 growth was associated with the continuing requirements of commercial banks for additional wholesale funds needed to meet persisting strong loan growth. For the year through July, M2 expanded at a rate in the upper half of its range for 1995, and M3 grew at a rate above its upwardly revised range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had been in the upper half of its monitoring range in recent months. ']
