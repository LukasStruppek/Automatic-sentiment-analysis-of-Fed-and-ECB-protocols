[" At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all except one member supported a directive that called for conditions in reserve markets that would be consistent with a slight decrease in the federal funds rate to an average of about 4-3/4 percent. These members also accepted a proposal to remove the bias toward easing that had been adopted at the previous meeting. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower federal funds rate would be acceptable during the the intermeeting period. A staff analysis prepared for this meeting suggested that the reserve conditions contemplated by the Committee were likely to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over the months ahead.
