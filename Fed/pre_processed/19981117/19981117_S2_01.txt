[" The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to point to considerable slowing in the expansion of economic activity to a pace appreciably below the estimated growth of the economy's potential, but the expansion was expected to pick up later to a rate more in line with that potential. Subdued expansion of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place considerable, albeit diminishing, restraint on the demand for U.S. exports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products. Domestic production also would be held back for a time by the efforts of firms to bring inventories into better balance with the anticipated moderation in the trajectory of final sales. In addition, private final demand would be restrained a bit by the tighter terms and conditions that were now imposed by many types of lenders and by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects stemming from earlier increases in equity prices. Pressures on labor resources were likely to ease somewhat as the expansion of economic activity moderated, but inflation was projected to rise considerably over the year ahead in association with a partial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year.
