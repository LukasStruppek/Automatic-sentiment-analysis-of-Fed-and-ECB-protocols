[' Foreign economic and financial developments were another important source of downside risk and uncertainty. The economic and financial turmoil in Asia had spread to numerous other nations around the world and to an extent to the United States. While economic weakness in many U.S. trading partners likely would continue to have adverse effects on net U.S. exports, the potential extent of such weakness was subject to considerable uncertainty as were the associated repercussions on financial markets. As they had at previous meetings, members referred to numerous anecdotal reports of heightened competition from foreign producers that was curbing the sales of many domestic manufacturers, notably in the steel industry, and in some other industries and agriculture. Moreover, the low level of world oil prices, which appeared to be importantly associated with diminished demand from Asian countries, was retarding production and reducing revenues in the U.S. energy and related industries. On the positive side, members commented that economic and financial conditions appeared to have stabilized or improved a bit in a number of Asian nations, though the recession in Japan showed little evidence of coming to an end, and the outlook for Brazil seemed a little more promising. However, economic and financial conditions in Brazil and a number of other countries remained very fragile. The recent depreciation of the dollar, while perhaps putting some upward pressure on prices, would damp the deterioration in net U.S. exports. ']
