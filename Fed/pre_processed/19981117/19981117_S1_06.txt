[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested some moderation in the expansion of economic activity from a brisk pace during the summer months. Although growth of economic activity in the third quarter apparently about matched the pace in the first half of the year, a large buildup of nonfarm inventories had accounted for a significant portion of the persisting strength of the expansion during the quarter. Growth in consumer spending had been well maintained during the summer months, and housing activity had remained at a high level. In other major sectors of the economy, business fixed investment had softened after having surged in the first half, and net exports had declined further, although at a reduced pace. Growth in employment had slowed appreciably on balance during the summer and early fall months, but tight conditions had persisted in most labor markets. Recent wage and price developments had been mixed. ']
