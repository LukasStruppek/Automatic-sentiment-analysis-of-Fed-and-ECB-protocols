[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened to some extent in July-August from its second-quarter average. The value of imports in the July-August period, though rising appreciably in August, was somewhat below the second-quarter average, with most of the decline involving automotive products and oil. The value of exports fell somewhat over the two months, largely reflecting declines in exports of automotive products and industrial supplies and reduced service transactions. Decreases in exports partly reflected weakness in foreign economies. In the third quarter, growth in economic activity slowed on average in the major industrial countries, other than Japan, from the average pace in the first half of the year and contracted for a fourth consecutive quarter in Japan. There were widespread indications in the industrial nations, particularly from surveys of business and consumer confidence, that some slowing was persisting into the fourth quarter. Elsewhere, the available evidence pointed to some improvement in economic trends in a number of Asian nations, but the economies of several sizable South American countries appeared to have weakened. Recent economic indicators for Mexico were mixed. ']
