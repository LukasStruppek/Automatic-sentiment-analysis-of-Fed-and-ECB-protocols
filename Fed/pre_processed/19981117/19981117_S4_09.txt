[" On the recommendation of the Manager, the Committee voted unanimously to amend the authorization for domestic open market operations to extend the maximum maturity of System repurchase agreements from 15 calendar days to 60 calendar days. The purpose of the expanded authority was to enhance the flexibility of the Manager in meeting reserve supplying objectives during periods of pronounced seasonal needs, notably those associated with the year-end. Subject to the Committee's approval, the Manager would initiate the System's use of extended-term repurchase agreements ahead of the coming year-end, and he anticipated that such use could prove to be especially advantageous in late 1999 to the extent that year 2000 concerns generated accentuated seasonal demand for currency. In addition, the availability of the extended funding could help to allay concerns in the federal funds market about the cost of financing during periods of peak seasonal pressures, with favorable effects on the market's functioning.
