[' At its meeting on September 29, 1998, the Committee adopted a directive that called for implementing conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with a one-quarter percentage point decrease in the federal funds rate to an average of around 5-1/4 percent. The Committee also decided to adopt an asymmetric directive that was tilted toward ease to highlight its view that the risks to the economic expansion were mainly on the downside and to underscore its readiness to respond promptly to developments that threatened the sustainability of the expansion. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over subsequent months. ']
