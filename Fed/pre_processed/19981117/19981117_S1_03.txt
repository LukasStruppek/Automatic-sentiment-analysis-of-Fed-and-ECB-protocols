[" The Manager informed the Committee that he planned to initiate outright purchases in the secondary market of inflation-indexed Treasury securities. In the past, the System had been acquiring holdings of such securities in Treasury auctions in exchange for maturing nominal obligations. In the Manager's opinion, secondary market transactions would provide a helpful addition to the current range of assets that the System normally purchased, especially in a period of little or no increase in Treasury debt. Some members expressed concern that sizable purchases of indexed securities by the central bank might impair the liquidity of the market and limit the usefulness of these obligations as indicators of inflationary expectations. It was noted, however, that relatively limited System purchases of such securities were contemplated so that the market was not likely to be significantly affected. Moreover, the System's participation could contribute to a more active and liquid secondary market. "]
