[' Owing to the formation of the European Central Bank and in light of 15 years of disuse, the bilateral swap arrangements of the Federal Reserve with the Austrian National Bank, the National Bank of Belgium, the Bank of France, the German Federal Bank, the Bank of Italy and the Netherlands Bank were jointly deemed no longer to be necessary in view of the well established present-day arrangements for international monetary cooperation. Accordingly, it was agreed by all the bilateral parties to allow them to lapse. Similarly, it was jointly agreed to allow the bilateral swap arrangements between the Federal Reserve and the National Bank of Denmark, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Norway, the Bank of Sweden, the Swiss National Bank, and the Bank for International Settlements to lapse in light of their disuse and present day arrangements for international monetary cooperation.
