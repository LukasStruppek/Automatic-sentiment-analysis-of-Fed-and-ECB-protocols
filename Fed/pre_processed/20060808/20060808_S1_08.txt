The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles rose in May, and real nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles appeared to be slightly higher in the second quarter than earlier in the year. The ratio of book-value inventories to sales edged down in May in both the trade and manufacturing sectors after having remained relatively steady over the previous three months. In the manufacturing sector, however, inventories ticked up again in June. In general, inventories appeared to be well aligned with demand, and business surveys suggested that firms were comfortable with the level of inventories.
