Industrial production picked up in June. For the second quarter as a whole, it grew at a robust rate that was faster than its first-quarter pace. Gains in manufacturing production were widespread across industries. The mining sector, which includes oil and natural gas extraction, expanded solidly in June, although average growth in the second quarter was below that of the first quarter, in part because the recovery from the disruptions caused by last years hurricanes neared completion. Utilities output grew strongly in the second quarter. The rate of capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector stepped up in June and remained above its long-run average.
