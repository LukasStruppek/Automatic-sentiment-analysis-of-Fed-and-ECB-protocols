After surging in the first quarter, real spending on equipment and software edged down in the second quarter. The decline was accounted for primarily by a drop in expenditures on communications and transportation equipment. Spending on high-tech equipment and software declined as well. The construction of nonresidential buildings moved up at a solid pace over the first half of the year, although activity remained well short of its previous peak in mid-2000. Outlays on drilling and mining structures continued to climb in response to high energy prices, and spending on office construction edged up as vacancy rates continued to trend down. Overall, economic fundamentals and business sentiment continued to support increased investment.
