Activity in the housing market moderated in January and February from its elevated pace in the fourth quarter. Single-family housing starts and permits stepped down, although both measures remained above their average levels of the first three quarters of 2003. Housing starts in the multifamily sector slipped only slightly from the fourth quarter pace, even though vacancy rates reached a record high level in the fourth quarter. Sales of new and existing homes slowed in January, but this change retraced only a small part of the extraordinary run-up in home sales that began last spring. Home prices continued to rise briskly.
