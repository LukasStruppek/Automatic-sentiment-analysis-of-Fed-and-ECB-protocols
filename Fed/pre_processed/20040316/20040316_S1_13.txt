Although the Committee's decision at the January meeting to keep the federal funds rate unchanged had been widely anticipated, the changes in the wording of the accompanying statement elicited a sharp reaction in financial markets. Investors moved up the date when they expected policy tightening to commence, resulting in a jump in Treasury yields. Over the balance of the intermeeting period, however, the Chairman's testimony on monetary policy and data on nonfarm payroll employment with a weakish cast persuaded investors that policy tightening was still some ways off. Treasury yields declined considerably in response and ended the intermeeting period lower, on balance. Yields on inflation-indexed securities also fell, leaving measures of inflation compensation little changed.
