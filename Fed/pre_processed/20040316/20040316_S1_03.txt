The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace in early 2004. Consumer spending growth appeared to have picked up somewhat, and activity in the housing market remained at high levels. In the business sector, spending for equipment and software was apparently advancing vigorously, and firms were adding modestly to their inventories. Still, the increases in economic activity had not yet generated sizable gains in employment. Core consumer price inflation remained low, and expectations of future inflation continued to be subdued.
