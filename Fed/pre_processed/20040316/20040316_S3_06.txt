The Committee anticipated that government spending would provide some further support for aggregate demand going forward. The budget pressures that had constrained state and local government expenditures of late were easing in some cases, and federal outlays were expected to rise. Fiscal policy was seen as providing less stimulus to aggregate demand in 2005 than this year, but the federal budget deficit was expected to remain substantial.
