The January and February employment reports depicted a labor market that was slow to pick up momentum. The modest gains posted in private nonfarm payrolls over the period were smaller than had been expected by most forecasters. Employment in the manufacturing sector, which had fallen continually for over three years, was essentially unchanged in February, while employment in other sectors showed mixed changes. Average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers edged above the average level of the fourth quarter of 2003. Despite the weakness in employment, the unemployment rate in January and February came in below its fourth-quarter level.
