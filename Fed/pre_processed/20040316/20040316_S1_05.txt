Industrial production moved up briskly in January and February following strong increases in the fourth quarter. These gains in production were realized across a wide set of industries. High-tech industries, including semiconductors, computers, and communications equipment, posted particularly strong advances, while the production of motor vehicles and the output of other manufacturing sectors were also strong. Outside the manufacturing sector, power generation by utilities surged in January but fell back in February in response to outsized swings in average temperatures during those months. Capacity utilization continued to move higher in January and February, although it remained below its longer-run average.
