Consumer spending growth in recent months appeared to pick up somewhat from its pace in the fourth quarter of 2003. Retail sales rose briskly, on average, in January and February, and spending on services was up in January (the most recent month for which data were available). In contrast, purchases of motor vehicles slipped in January and February from the strong pace in the fourth quarter. Overall, expenditures were supported by sizable gains in real disposable personal income and increases in household wealth owing to rising home and equity prices. Disposable income was boosted by significant growth in private wages and salaries and by a drop in taxes that was due to the lower final payments and higher refunds associated with last year's tax cut. Surveys indicated that consumer sentiment moved higher in January but subsequently fell back. Despite the pullback, sentiment remained above the levels seen during most of 2003.
