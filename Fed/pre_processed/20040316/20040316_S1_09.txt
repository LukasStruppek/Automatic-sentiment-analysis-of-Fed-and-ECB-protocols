Real nonfarm inventory investment remained modest in recent months. Although manufacturers' inventories moved higher in January, that increase primarily reflected stockbuilding at producers of petroleum and coal products. Retail inventories also rose in January, as stocks at auto dealers increased; wholesalers accumulated inventories at a modest pace. Inventory-sales ratios in these sectors lingered at or near their historical lows.
