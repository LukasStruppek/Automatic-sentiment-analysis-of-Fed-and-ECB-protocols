Core consumer price inflation stayed very low in early 2004. Over the twelve months ending in January, the increase in core consumer prices was around 1 percent--about Â¾ percentage point below the increase over the preceding twelve months. Total consumer price inflation, however, was boosted in January by a surge in energy prices. Incoming information on trends in labor costs were more mixed. The average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose modestly over the twelve months ending in February, decelerating from its year-earlier pace. By contrast, the employment cost index for hourly compensation in private industry grew a bit faster over the twelve months ending in December than over the year-earlier period.
