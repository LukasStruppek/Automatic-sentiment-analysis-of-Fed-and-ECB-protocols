At its January meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4Àù percent. In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, although recent economic data had been uneven, the expansion in economic activity appeared solid. Core inflation had stayed relatively low in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations had remained contained. Nevertheless, the Committee noted that possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices had the potential to add to inflation pressures. In these circumstances, the Committee judged that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance but reiterated that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster its objectives.
