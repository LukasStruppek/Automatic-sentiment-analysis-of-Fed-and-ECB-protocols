The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles rose at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter of 2005, and inventories appeared to have continued to build in January. Much of the increase reflected rising prices of goods held, and real inventory accumulation was subdued. The inventory-sales ratio declined slightly in January, extending its long-run downward trend. Inventory stocks appeared to be well aligned with demand in most industries.
