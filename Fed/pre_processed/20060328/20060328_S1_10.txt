Readings on core consumer price inflation were favorable in recent months. Nonetheless, the overall consumer price index edged up in February after registering a large increase in January that was driven mostly by a spike in energy prices. While prices of food and core items recorded only modest increases in February, energy prices fell back amid increases in oil inventories and unseasonably mild temperatures since the latter part of December. Weekly data for March, however, indicated that gasoline prices rose sharply. Prices of capital equipment inched up in February after a more substantial gain in January. Nevertheless, prices of capital equipment decelerated over the past twelve months. Higher energy prices still seemed to be passing through to the prices of a number of core intermediate materials, although such increases were more moderate than those observed in the immediate aftermath of the hurricanes last autumn. The increase in the employment cost index in the fourth quarter of 2005 was relatively modest. Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector, after having increased substantially in the third quarter, was estimated to have risen somewhat less in the fourth quarter. Preliminary survey measures of short-term inflation expectations in March edged up, but longer-term measures remained steady.
