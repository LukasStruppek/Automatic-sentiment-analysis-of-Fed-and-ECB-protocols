Meeting participants discussed at some length signs of cooling in the residential real estate market. Published data on housing starts showed little evidence of a significant weakening in construction activity. However, anecdotal reports from several markets, surveys of homebuyer attitudes, and data on inventories, home sales, and new home cancellation rates all pointed to a moderation in housing activity. It was noted that the relatively robust data on construction activity could owe in part to unseasonably warm weather. Going forward, participants expected a deceleration in house prices to contribute to an increase in the household saving rate and to weigh on consumption growth. Aggregate demand was also expected to be restrained directly by a softening in the pace of home building. Moreover, rebuilding following last year's major hurricanes appeared to be proceeding at a slow pace, and so would provide only limited offset to the implications of more fundamental developments in this market.
