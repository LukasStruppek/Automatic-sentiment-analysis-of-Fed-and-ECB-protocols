Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt appeared to have moderated only a bit in the first quarter from its robust pace in the fourth quarter of 2005. Net issuance of corporate bonds and expansion of business loans at commercial banks had abated in February and early March after robust growth in January; commercial paper outstanding was about flat in the first quarter. Household mortgage borrowing was thought to have slowed somewhat in the first quarter in response to increased mortgage interest rates. Consumer credit rebounded some in January after contracting in the fourth quarter because of elevated charge-offs related to the spike in bankruptcy filings. Based on monthly Treasury statements, federal debt seemed likely to have accelerated in the first quarter. On average, M2 grew briskly in January and February. While liquid deposits expanded moderately, small time deposits and retail money funds advanced strongly, supported by further increases in offering rates.
