M2 balances were about flat on average over the previous two months: After contracting a bit in July, M2 expanded slightly in August. Money growth was damped by a rise in the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets (as typically occurs in periods of policy tightening). In addition, the lift to M2 from mortgage refinancings in evidence during the spring was likely still unwinding over the past couple of months, depressing the growth of liquid deposits. Business loans at banks expanded in August for the third consecutive month.
