In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective developments, the members agreed that the economy had strengthened somewhat after going through a "soft patch" in late spring and early summer. Recent data and anecdotal information suggested solid growth ahead, but at a pace that could well be less brisk than previously anticipated. Consumer spending appeared to have rebounded in the third quarter. Business investment also was robust, but executives, especially those at larger firms, seemed more cautious about the outlook than they had been several months ago. Although higher energy prices had played an important role in damping growth, questions remained about the reasons for the shortfall from expectations held this spring, and several policymakers remarked that their uncertainty about the likely pace of the expansion going forward had risen. Members commented that the benign incoming data on prices tended to confirm their previous judgment that the increase in inflation earlier in the year had importantly reflected temporary factors and that core inflation would probably remain relatively low.
