Core consumer prices edged up slightly over the months of June and July, as inflation in both goods and services moderated. The core PCE price index was flat in July but, like the core CPI, was up a bit on balance over June and July. The twelve-month change in core consumer prices based on either measure was somewhat higher this July than for the same period last year. Retail energy prices fell in July, led by a drop in gasoline prices after large gains in a number of earlier months. During the summer, gasoline inventories climbed above seasonal norms because of lower demand and increased imports, and the resulting downward pressure on margins led gasoline prices to fall even as crude oil prices moved higher. Owing to the decline in energy prices in July, inflation in overall consumer prices slowed that month. In August, households' expectations for consumer inflation in the year ahead edged lower for the second consecutive month. Meanwhile, after a small rise in July, the prices of finished goods faced by producers moved down a bit in August. Turning to labor costs, hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector rose at a faster pace in the second quarter than it did in the first, but the advance was in line with the average rate of increase over the preceding four quarters. Unit labor costs measured at nonfinancial corporations also registered an increase in the second quarter.
