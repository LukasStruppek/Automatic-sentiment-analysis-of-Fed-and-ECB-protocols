Committee members interpreted recent data and anecdotal information as indicating that growth in consumer spending was rebounding fr om its relatively slow rate of late spring. They saw household spending as most likely continuing to expand at a solid pace going forward. Gains in nominal income, partly resulting from gradual increases in employment, were expected to continue to support consumer spending and low interest rates to buoy residential investment. However, members perceived several possible sources of downside risk to household spending. In particular, households might hold back on spending in an attempt to increase their saving, which had fallen to a very low level relative to income. The ebbing of stimulus from last year's tax cuts also could tend to slow growth in consumer spending. And a failure of employment to accelerate as expected could undermine consumer confidence as well as hold down the growth in personal income.
