Committee members generally viewed labor market conditions as having improved modestly of late. Although payroll growth had been weak in June and July, it registered a somewhat better performance in August, and initial claims for unemployment insurance continued to hover around relatively low levels. Some members noted a mismatch between demand and supply for certain types of labor. In particular, unskilled workers were said to be having considerable difficulty finding jobs, while firms were facing challenges in hiring workers with some specific skills, including truck drivers and heavy-equipment operators. Partly as a result, businesses in a few sectors, such as transportation and construction, reportedly were experiencing constraints on their output. Overall, however, some slack appeared to remain in labor markets. Looking forward, policymakers expected gradual improvement in labor market conditions as the economy expanded. However, anecdotal information suggested that many firms remained quite cautious about expanding payrolls, citing, among other factors, continued uncertainty about economic prospects and the high cost of providing health care benefits.
