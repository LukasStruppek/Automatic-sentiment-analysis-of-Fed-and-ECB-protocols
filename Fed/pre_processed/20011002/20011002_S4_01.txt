In the discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal calling for some further easing of reserve conditions consistent with a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate to a level of 2-1/2 percent. While monetary policy had already been eased substantially this year, the increased evidence of a faltering economy and the decidedly downside risks in the outlook called for a further move at this meeting. Easing would help limit the extent of the downturn and later provide impetus to the eventual upturn in economic activity. Further vigorous easing action would tend to support business and household confidence, which a number of members saw as especially important in the current circumstances. Even after a 50 basis point reduction, the federal funds rate would not reflect an unusually accommodative policy stance in that, in real terms, it would still be positive by many measures and above its typical level in most earlier periods of economic weakness. Moreover, the decline in stock market prices and the widening of risk spreads had damped the stimulative financial effects of the Committee's earlier easing actions. The relatively low level of inflation and well-contained inflationary expectations allowed the Committee flexibility to focus on countering the downside risks to the economy without incurring a significant threat of fostering expectations of higher inflation. Monetary policy is a flexible instrument and, with inflation expectations likely to remain relatively benign, policy could be reversed in a timely manner later should stimulative policy measures and the inherent resiliency of the economy begin to foster an unsustainable pace of economic expansion.
