anxiety among contacts in the business sector. Spending for equipment and software and for commercial structures had been declining sharply through the summer, with only a few tentative signs that the pace of decline might be about to ebb. According to contacts, intensified concerns about prospects for sales and profits were depressing investment further by fostering an increasingly widespread wait-and-see attitude about undertaking new investment expenditures. While nationwide statistics on expenditures in the period since the terrorist attacks were not yet available, anecdotal reports pointed to especially large cutbacks in planned spending for commercial aircraft and rental cars stemming from the sudden and sharp deterioration of activity in the travel and tourist industries. Reports from banking contacts also indicated a substantial drop in demand for business loans that was attributed in part to the diminished willingness of small businesses in particular to undertake new investments in capital equipment and other production facilities. More generally, the increase in uncertainty and the decline in business confidence and corporate profits along with the currently high levels of excess capacity in many industries pointed to the persistence of poor prospects for capital spending over the short to intermediate term, with declines in outlays for high-tech products expected to remain especially pronounced. Looking further ahead, however, a robust upturn in business capital spending was still a probable outcome. Businesses likely would respond to profit opportunities stemming not only from rising demand resulting in part from fiscal and monetary stimulus but also from ongoing technological improvements and the need for new capital equipment as the process of retrenchment from earlier overinvestments was completed.
