In the period before the terrorist attacks, federal funds traded at rates near the reduced target level established at the August meeting. Most market interest rates edged lower over that period in response to generally downbeat news on the economy, and broad stock market indexes fell appreciably. For a few days after September 11, with federal funds brokerage disrupted, banks generally agreed to trade reserves at the 3-1/2 percent federal funds target rate then prevailing. As more normal functioning resumed in the federal funds market, the rate fell well below the Committee's formal targets, including the reduced rate set on September 17. By the latter part of September and early October, however, the effective rate was fluctuating around the new target level. After the terrorist attacks, rates on short- and intermediate-term Treasury securities fell appreciably further, as did yields on highly rated obligations such as federal agency debt. However, the yield declines did not extend to long-term Treasury bonds, which changed little as investors apparently reacted to the deteriorating outlook for the federal budget surplus and prospectively larger Treasury bond supplies. Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds also were little changed, but rates on high-yield bonds, evidently reflecting increased investor aversion to holding risky securities, rose sharply in very thin markets. In the stock market, broad equity price measures fell considerably further in volatile trading after the markets reopened on September 17, but part of those losses had been recovered by the time of this meeting.
