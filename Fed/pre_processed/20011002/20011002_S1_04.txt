Data for August portrayed some continued softening in overall labor market conditions. Private nonfarm payroll employment fell appreciably further, with the decline more than accounted for by additional job losses in manufacturing. Labor demand remained sluggish in most other sectors, though some pickup was reported in services. The unemployment rate rose to 4.9 percent in August, its highest level in four years. A sharp increase in initial claims for unemployment insurance in recent weeks was suggestive of additional deterioration in labor markets.
