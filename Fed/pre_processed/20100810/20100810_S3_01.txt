 In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants generally characterized the economic information received during the intermeeting period as indicating a slowing in the pace of recovery in output and employment in recent months Real GDP growth was noticeably weaker in the second quarter of 2010 than most had anticipated, and monthly data suggested that the pace of recovery remained sluggish going into the third quarter Private payrolls and consumer spending had risen less than expected Business spending on equipment and software had increased strongly but reportedly was concentrated in replacements and upgrades that had been postponed during the economic downturn Investment in nonresidential structures continued to be weak Housing starts and sales remained at depressed levels, falling back after the expiration of the temporary homebuyer tax credits The incoming data suggested that economic growth abroad had been somewhat stronger than anticipated and remained solid, boosting US exports and supporting a pickup in US manufacturing output and employment, though a surprising surge in imports in the second quarter widened the US trade deficit Conditions in financial markets had become somewhat more supportive of growth over the intermeeting period, in part reflecting perceptions of diminished risk of financial dislocations in Europe: Medium- and longer-term interest rates had fallen, some risk spreads had narrowed, and the decline in equity prices that had occurred in the months before the Committee's June meeting had been partly reversed Moreover, participants saw some indications that credit conditions for households and smaller businesses were beginning to improve, albeit gradually Thus, while they saw growth as likely to be more modest in the near term, participants continued to anticipate that growth would pick up in 2011
