Yields on short- and medium-term nominal Treasury securities rose, on balance, over the intermeeting period. In contrast, yields at the long end of the curve declined, continuing a downward trend evident over much of this year. Market participants cited a number of factors as contributing to the drop in long-term yields so far this year, including portfolio reallocation by large institutional investors, the trading strategies pursued by some investors, and safe-haven flows. Some market participants reportedly also revised down their estimate of the average real federal funds rate over the longer term, reflecting in part changes in their assessments of long-run economic conditions. Measures of longer-horizon inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities were little changed.
