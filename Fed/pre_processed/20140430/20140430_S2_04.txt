Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) expanded slightly less rapidly in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter. After moving roughly sideways, on net, in January and February, the component of nominal retail sales used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to construct its monthly estimate of PCE rose briskly in March, in part because the weather returned to more seasonal norms. Recent information on several important factors that influence household spending was positive. Real disposable income continued to increase in the first quarter, further gains in house prices likely bolstered household net worth, and consumer sentiment in the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers improved, on balance, in March and April.
