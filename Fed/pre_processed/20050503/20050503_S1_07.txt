Growth of business spending on equipment and software moderated substantially in the first quarter from the very high rates of last year, but appeared to retain considerable momentum; strong gains occurred in all major categories except motor vehicles. This performance reflected favorable underlying fundamentals, including solid growth in business output, strong retained earnings, high levels of liquid assets, and favorable borrowing conditions in the form of low interest rates and narrow risk spreads in bond and loan markets. At the same time, construction of nonresidential structures remained quite subdued. Over the first quarter, outlays for manufacturing facilities picked up a bit, but those for office buildings stayed low despite some declines in the office vacancy rate, and spending on commercial structures fell.
