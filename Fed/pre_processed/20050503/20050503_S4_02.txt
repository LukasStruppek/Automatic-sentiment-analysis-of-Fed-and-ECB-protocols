In discussing the statement to be released after the meeting, members agreed that it was appropriate to acknowledge that rising energy prices seemed to have spurred an increase in core measures of inflation by dropping the reference from the March statement indicating that "The rise in energy prices, however, has not notably fed through to core consumer prices." They likewise all agreed that mention should be made that, on balance, longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained. Regarding the risks to sustainable growth and price stability, some members noted that the risk assessment conditioned on "appropriate policy" no longer seemed to convey useful information regarding the Committee's economic and policy outlook. Although some members noted that a case could be made that the risks to inflation were now somewhat skewed to the upside and those to sustainable economic growth perhaps to the downside, the most likely outcome remained one of stable prices and sustainable growth, and the Committee agreed that it should retain a balanced assessment of risks conditional on appropriate policy.
