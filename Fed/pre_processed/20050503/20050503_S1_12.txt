The FOMC's decision in March to raise the intended level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points was fully anticipated by the market, as were its retention in the accompanying statement of the "measured pace" language and its assessment that the risks to price stability and sustainable economic growth were balanced. Interest rates, however, rose, reportedly in response to the statement's references to increased price pressures and to more evident pricing power as well as to the Committee's conditioning of its risk assessment on "appropriate monetary policy action." Interest rates rose further the next day following the release of a larger-than-expected increase in the CPI for February. Over subsequent weeks, however, these increases were more than reversed by weaker-than-expected data on consumer spending, consumer sentiment, and output. Further downward pressure on interest rates was exerted by the market's response to the release of the minutes of the March meeting, as attention focused on the reference to Committee members' judgment that an accelerated path of policy tightening was not necessary at that time. Despite generally good first-quarter earnings reports, equity indexes moved down considerably in response to the signs of weaker economic growth. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar rose on balance, apparently due, in part, to disappointing news on employment and output abroad.
