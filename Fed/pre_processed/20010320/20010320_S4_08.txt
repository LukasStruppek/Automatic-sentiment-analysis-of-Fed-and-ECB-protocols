A week later, on April 18, 2001, the Committee held a telephone conference meeting for the purpose of considering a policy easing action. The members noted that the statistical and anecdotal information received since the last conference call had supported their view that an easing of policy would be appropriate. In addition to the continuing concerns about business plans for capital investment, consumer spending had leveled out and confidence had fallen further. In these circumstances, lower interest rates were likely to be necessary to foster more satisfactory economic expansion. With financial markets more settled, and with nearly a month until the Committee's May meeting, an easing move was called for at this time.
