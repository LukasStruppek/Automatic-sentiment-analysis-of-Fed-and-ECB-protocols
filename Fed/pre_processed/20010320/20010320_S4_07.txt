On April 11, 2001, the Committee reviewed economic and financial developments since its last meeting and discussed the possible need for some further easing of monetary policy. The data and anecdotal information were mixed: They did not indicate that the economy had been weakening further, but they raised questions about the potential strength of a rebound in growth over coming quarters. In particular, heightened business concerns about future sales and further downward revisions to expected earnings threatened to restrain capital spending for some time. In the circumstances, the members could see the need for a further easing of policy at some point, though some had a strong preference for taking such actions at regularly scheduled meetings. They all agreed that an easing on this date would not be advisable, inasmuch as the attendant surprise to most outside observers risked unpredictable reactions in financial markets that had been especially volatile in recent days, and additional important data would become available over the near term.
