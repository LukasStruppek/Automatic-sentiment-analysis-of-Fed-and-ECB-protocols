Private nonfarm payroll employment turned up in April after having posted small declines in February and March and steep reductions earlier. Job gains in April were spread across a wide range of industries. The services sector registered a sizable increase, with much of that rise occurring in the temporary-help industry that provides many of its workers to the manufacturing sector. In addition, layoffs continued to slow in the manufacturing sector, and some industries recorded their first solid advances in employment in more than a year. By contrast, the construction industry posted another large job decline as hiring again fell short of the usual seasonal rise. Despite the pickup in private payrolls, the unemployment rate rose to 6.0 percent in April, perhaps reflecting to an important extent the incentives created by the new federal program of extended unemployment benefits for some jobless workers to continue, or resume, looking for work.
