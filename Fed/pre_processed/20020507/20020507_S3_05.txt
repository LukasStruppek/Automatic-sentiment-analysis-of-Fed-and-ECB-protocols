The markedly reduced pace of inventory liquidation in the first quarter of the year accounted for much of the step-up in GDP growth in that quarter and provided a strong indication that the period of inventory liquidation under way for more than a year probably was coming to an end. Indeed, anecdotal reports suggested that efforts to rebuild inventories were now being undertaken in a number of industries, such as steel and motor vehicles, and one regional survey indicated that businesses planned to accumulate inventories over the next six months. However, businesses remained quite cautious about the outlook for sales, and many firms might also be in the process of adapting to much reduced levels of inventories in relation to sales rather than restoring earlier inventory-sales ratios. A shift to inventory stocking in the near term, possibly in the current quarter, was seen as a reasonable expectation, but with numerous firms having already moved production into closer alignment with sales, members anticipated much less impetus to overall economic activity from inventories over coming quarters.
