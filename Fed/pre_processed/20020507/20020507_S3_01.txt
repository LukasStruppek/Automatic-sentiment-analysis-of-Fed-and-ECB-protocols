In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that recently available statistical data and anecdotal reports suggested that the expansion in business activity was continuing. However, it had slowed considerably from its pace earlier in the year when it had received substantial impetus from a marked slowing in the runoff of inventories. How much final demand would strengthen going forward was still uncertain. A pause in the expansion was not an unusual development during the early stages of a cyclical recovery, and the members generally viewed a pickup in growth as a reasonable expectation. The currently stimulative stance of both fiscal and monetary policy would tend to undergird final demand, especially in the context of an economy that had exhibited a marked degree of resilience and strength in underlying productivity growth that would bolster household incomes and provide incentives for business capital spending. Members noted, however, that an already high level of consumer spending pointed to more limited than usual scope for further growth in such spending, and gloomy business sentiment in the face of disappointing sales and profits raised a question about the extent to which business investment would help to lift final demand over coming quarters. Given growth in economic activity broadly in line with current expectations, inflation was likely to remain benign for some time in the context of an apparently strong uptrend in structural labor productivity, excess capacity in many labor and product markets, and a related absence of pricing power in generally very competitive markets.
