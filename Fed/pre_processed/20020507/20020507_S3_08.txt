The outlook for inflation remained favorable. Nearly all measures of total and core prices had decelerated over the past year, and in the context of forecasts implying a continued sizable gap between actual and potential output, the risk that inflationary pressures would intensify significantly over coming quarters appeared to be quite limited; indeed, inflation might edge a bit lower in the early stages of the expansion. The deceleration in labor costs over the past several quarters, evidence of a surprisingly strong uptrend in structural labor productivity, low and stable inflation expectations, and the widespread absence of pricing power in highly competitive markets were signs that upside inflation risks in the period ahead were relatively small. The members recognized nonetheless that there were upward pressures on costs in a number of areas. These included significant increases in energy costs in recent months, evidence of an upturn in some industrial prices, sharp increases in many insurance costs, continuing upward pressures on medical costs, and modest recent declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. With the stance of monetary policy currently quite accommodative, the members saw the need for careful monitoring of the potential for rising inflation pressures as the economic recovery gained momentum.
