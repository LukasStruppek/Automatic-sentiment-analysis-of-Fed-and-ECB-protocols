The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that economic activity expanded rapidly early in the year. Consumer spending increased moderately after large gains around the turn of the year, business outlays on durable equipment and software apparently steadied after a long decline, and single-family housing activity persisted at a relatively high level. Industrial production picked up in response to the advance in final demand and a slowdown in the runoff of excess inventory stocks. The demand for labor began to firm in April. Available information suggested that labor productivity had risen substantially in the first quarter. Although the recent surge in energy prices boosted headline consumer inflation in the first quarter, core measures of inflation had trended lower over the past year.
