The members generally viewed business fixed investment as the key sector that would determine the strength of the expansion. Such investment had contracted further in the first quarter, but the decline was the smallest in a year. Looking ahead, the members anticipated a sluggish and delayed upturn in capital expenditures in the next few quarters against the backdrop of persistently gloomy business sentiment and large margins of excess capacity in numerous industries. Many business contacts commented on their unwillingness to expand capacity until they saw persuasive evidence of growing sales and profits. Accordingly, much of their current investment spending was focused on cost-saving equipment and software in an effort to bolster profits in a stable-price environment that made it difficult to pass on rising costs. The recent passage of temporary legislation that permitted a partial acceleration of tax expensing was expected to provide some impetus to capital investments, but the legislation appeared to have had little effect thus far. With regard to the outlook for nonresidential construction, members saw little prospect of any material increase in such construction over the next several quarters, given widespread anecdotal and statistical reports of high vacancy rates and excess capacity.
