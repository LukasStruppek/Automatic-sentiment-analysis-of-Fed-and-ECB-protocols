The Committee also approved a temporary financing facility authorizing the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to sell options on repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and matched sale purchase transactions. The members hoped that the availability of such a System facility would reduce concerns about year-end financial conditions and thus help avert the emergence of the illiquid markets that were feared by an apparently growing number of market participants and that would complicate the conduct of open market operations. The sales would be made on a competitive basis to the primary government securities dealers who are regular counterparties in the System's open market operations. The details of these transactions would be worked out during the weeks ahead.
