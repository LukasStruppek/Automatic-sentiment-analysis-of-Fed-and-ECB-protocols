Consumer prices rose moderately in July after having been unchanged in May and June; a rebound in energy prices contributed to the July increase. The strong upturn in energy prices this year accounted for all of the uptick in consumer price inflation in the twelve months ended in July compared with the previous twelve-month period. Excluding food as well as the volatile energy components, core consumer price inflation had remained subdued thus far in 1999 and during the twelve months ended in July. Inflation was modest at the producer level as well, as prices of finished goods other than food and energy edged lower over the June-July period. Core producer prices rose more in the twelve months ended in July than in the year-earlier period, but that pickup resulted in important part from sharp increases in the prices of tobacco products. At earlier stages of processing, producer prices of crude and intermediate materials other than food and energy had firmed noticeably in recent months. While the source of some of those increases had been the pass--through of higher crude oil prices, improved worldwide growth, especially in Asia, also contributed. With labor markets very tight, increases in wages and total compensation had been somewhat larger recently. The employer cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers jumped in the second quarter after an unusually small gain in the first quarter, and increases in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers picked up in June and July. Nonetheless, year-over-year changes in some measures of nominal compensation continued to decline.
