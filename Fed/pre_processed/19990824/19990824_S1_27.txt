The expansion of broad measures of money had moderated in recent months. The slower growth of nominal GDP and the rise in market interest rates in the spring and summer likely had restrained increases in both M2 and M3. In addition, M3's expansion probably had been held down by a sharp slowing in the growth of bank credit in July. For the year through July, M2 was estimated to have increased at a rate somewhat above the Committee's annual range and M3 at a rate approximating the upper end of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had continued to expand at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range, though borrowing by nonfinancial sectors had slowed in recent months.
