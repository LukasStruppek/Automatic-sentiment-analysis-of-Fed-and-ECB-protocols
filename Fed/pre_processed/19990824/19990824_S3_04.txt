Residential construction activity was expected to moderate a bit over coming quarters as the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates exerted its lagged effects. The deceleration was likely to be limited in the near term, however, as the backlogs that had built up earlier in the year and associated shortages in inventories of new homes were worked down. Indeed, anecdotal reports indicated currently strong housing markets in several areas of the country. Over time, the outlook for employment and incomes should provide support to the housing market, but likely at a modestly diminished level.
