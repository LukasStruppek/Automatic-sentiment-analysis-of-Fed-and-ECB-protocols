The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that expansion of economic activity remained solid. The growth of consumer spending and business outlays for durable equipment had moderated somewhat after increasing rapidly earlier in the year. Residential construction activity had weakened a little from the level of last winter but was still elevated. Job growth was quite strong, however, and industrial production appeared to be picking up. Labor markets remained very tight, and recent wage and price increases had been a little larger on balance, though price inflation continued subdued.
