The government sector was now expected to exert somewhat less restraint on overall demand in the economy, as burgeoning budget surpluses seemed to be weakening restraints on federal government outlays and tax cuts were a possibility. In addition, export growth was projected to strengthen in conjunction with an improving economic outlook in a number of important U.S. trading partners, and import growth seemed likely to moderate over the next several quarters, reflecting the projected deceleration in the U.S. economy and the waning effects of the past appreciation of the dollar. A number of members commented, however, that they saw downside risks to the trade outlook despite the improving economic performance in many countries. Adverse developments in those countries remained a worrisome concern in light of unsettled political conditions that made it very difficult for government authorities in many of them to implement the measures that were needed to solve underlying economic problems.
