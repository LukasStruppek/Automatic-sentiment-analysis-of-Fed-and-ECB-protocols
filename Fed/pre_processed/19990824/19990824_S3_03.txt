With regard to the outlook for key sectors of the economy, members referred to the favorable prospects for continued robust growth in employment and incomes that likely would sustain appreciable further expansion in consumer expenditures. However, substantial uncertainty surrounded the outlook for stock market prices whose sharp rise and the associated increase in wealth over the course of recent years had helped to foster a high level of consumer confidence and willingness to spend. The absence of further large gains in stock prices, should recent trends persist, would remove this stimulus and probably induce some moderation in the growth of consumer spending. However, as the experience of recent years had amply demonstrated, stock market trends were very difficult to predict. Concerning the prospects for business capital investment, members saw indications that outlays might rise more moderately after a surge in the second quarter. Weak trends in orders for many types of equipment and softness in nonresidential construction pointed to a considerable deceleration in total business investment. At the same time, however, further advances in technology and declining prices were likely to underpin continued very strong expenditures for computer and communications equipment, thereby sustaining still robust if reduced increases in overall business investment.
