The new authority encompassed three policy instruments that, unless renewed, would expire during the early part of 2000 and one permanent change. The temporary authorizations included (1) the expansion of collateral that could be accepted in System open market transactions, (2) authority to use reverse repurchase agreements in addition to the currently available matched sales purchase transactions to absorb reserves on a temporary basis, and (3) a standby financing facility involving the auction of options on repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and matched sale purchase transactions that could be exercised in the period surrounding the year-end. The permanent change, which also might prove useful during the year-end period, involved the extension of the maximum maturity on regular repurchase and matched sale purchase transactions from 60 days to 90 days.
