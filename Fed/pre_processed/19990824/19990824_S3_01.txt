In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the expansion of economic activity continued to display substantial underlying strength with few indications of slowing in the growth of consumer and business expenditures. While the information for the second quarter pointed to a marked deceleration from the pace in other recent quarters, the slowdown was induced to an important extent by sharply reduced inventory investment that partly offset robust further growth in consumer and housing expenditures and a surge in spending by business for equipment. The members generally anticipated a rebound in the rate of economic expansion over the balance of the year and in 2000, possibly to a pace averaging around the economy's long-run potential. Growth at this rate would represent a noticeable slowing from the pace that had prevailed in recent years, and its realization depended importantly on the damping effects on domestic demand of the less accommodative financial conditions that had developed in recent months--higher long-term interest rates and a flattening of equity prices. Given the persistent strength of domestic demand and improving economies abroad, many members saw the risks to this outlook as tilted to the upside, especially if short-term interest rates were to remain at their current levels. Against this background, the risks in the outlook for prices also seemed to be tilted toward somewhat higher inflation. Price inflation had been held in check by accelerating productivity and declines in oil and other import prices. Evidence was mixed on whether the acceleration in productivity was persisting, but the earlier favorable developments in import prices were already dissipating, adding to the inflation risk posed by the possibility of further tightening in labor markets should domestic demand fail to moderate.
