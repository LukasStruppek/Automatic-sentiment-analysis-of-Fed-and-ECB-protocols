In the course of the Committee's discussion of the outlook for inflation, members commented that there was no persuasive evidence in recent statistical measures that price inflation was currently picking up or that inflation expectations were rising, though the declines in both inflation and expectations experienced over the course of recent years no longer seemed to be occurring. Members nonetheless expressed concern about the risks of some acceleration under foreseeable economic circumstances. They cited a variety of statistical and anecdotal signs that could be viewed as harbingers of rising price inflation. Those included an upturn in commodity prices, notably that of oil whose effects tended over time to spread relatively widely through the economy, and the direct and indirect effects of the dollar's depreciation. Members also reported some indications of reduced discounting by business firms and plans for, or actual implementation of, higher prices that businesses now saw as less likely than earlier to be reversed for competitive reasons. However, these reports were still relatively scattered.
