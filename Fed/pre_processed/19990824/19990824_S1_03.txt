At this meeting, the Committee considered a number of proposals whose purpose was to enhance the Manager's ability to counter potential liquidity strains in money and financing markets in the period surrounding the century date change and in the process help to assure the effective implementation of the Committee's monetary policy objectives. The members believed that the prospects for major liquidity problems associated with the century date change were remote, but some strains were already in evidence, and they agreed that it would be prudent to provide the Manager with added leeway and flexibility for a limited period. Because the plans of market participants were likely to be influenced by the Federal Reserve's contemplated action and because detailed preparations with market participants needed to begin promptly, the Committee decided to put the new authorizations in place at this meeting.
