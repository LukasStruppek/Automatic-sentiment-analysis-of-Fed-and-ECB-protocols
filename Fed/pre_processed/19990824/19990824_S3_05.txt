The outlook for inventory investment remained characteristically uncertain, though the members commented that there were reasons to anticipate some pickup in such investment following the shortfall in the second quarter. While the long-run trend undoubtedly remained in the direction of declining inventory-sales ratios, the shortfall of inventory investment during the spring probably had on the whole lowered holdings at least temporarily below intended levels as evidenced in part by anecdotal reports that lean inventories had reduced sales in some areas. Moreover, some buildup relating to century date change concerns seemed likely; in this regard, anecdotal reports suggested that some businesses planned to accumulate inventories in the form of imports because of questions about the availability of such goods around the year-end. Members acknowledged that available survey and anecdotal evidence did not point to any widespread perception of a significant need to build up inventories, and indeed there were indications of overstocking in some industries. Even so, appreciable inventory accumulation was seen as the most likely prospect for the balance of the year. While such a forecast was subject to substantial risks in both directions, it implied, if realized, a significant boost to GDP growth over the second half of the year.
