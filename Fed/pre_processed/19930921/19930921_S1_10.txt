[' The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit decreased in July, but it remained essentially unchanged from its average rate in the second quarter. The value of exports edged lower in July, while the value of imports fell by more, retracing nearly all of the sizable June rise. The decline in imports was primarily in automotive products, consumer goods, and oil. The performance of the major foreign industrial economies continued to present a mixed picture. Economic activity in Japan, after increasing slightly in the first quarter, evidenced renewed weakness in the second quarter that apparently persisted into the third quarter. In western Germany, real output rose in the second quarter, but much of the gain apparently stemmed from unintended inventory accumulation. In France and Italy, economic activity appeared to have leveled out in the second quarter after declining earlier. By contrast, both the United Kingdom and Canada recorded further modest gains in economic activity. ']
