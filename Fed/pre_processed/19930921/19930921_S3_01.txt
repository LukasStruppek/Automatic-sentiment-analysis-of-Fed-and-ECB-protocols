[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that recent developments had not altered their outlook for moderate and sustained expansion in economic activity. The members acknowledged that the interpretation of ongoing developments presented some unusual problems, notably the difficulty of reconciling the appreciable growth in employment thus far this year with the slow expansion in measured output: the associated drop in measured productivity was especially surprising in light of the business drive toward more efficient operations. Moreover, the economic outlook clearly remained subject to a variety of uncertainties, including potential developments abroad that were especially difficult to predict. Nonetheless, while temporary factors were likely to depress third-quarter expansion, the members saw little in the current statistical or anecdotal reports on the domestic economy that pointed to the likelihood of a significant deviation from a moderate growth trend. It was noted in this connection that the inhibiting effects of increased fiscal restraint and expected further weakness in net exports needed to be weighed against the favorable effects on interest-sensitive spending of considerably reduced intermediate- and long-term interest rates and the much improved financial condition of many business firms and households. With regard to the outlook for inflation, some members suggested that the prospects for continued slack in resource utilization were consistent with a disinflationary trend, but the disparate factors bearing on the outlook for inflation as well as the swings in price performance experienced in recent quarters argued for caution in assessing the future course of inflation.
