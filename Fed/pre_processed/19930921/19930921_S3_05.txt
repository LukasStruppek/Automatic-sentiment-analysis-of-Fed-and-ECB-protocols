[' Cautious attitudes also appeared to have held back housing demand and construction activity despite declines in mortgage interest rates. The combination of some further declines in mortgage interest rates recently and a tendency for house prices to stabilize or even to firm in some markets seemed to have induced appreciable and widespread strengthening in demand for single-family housing. Indeed, despite persisting weakness in some areas, housing markets were described as quite strong in many parts of the country, and the overall improvement in housing activity might not be captured in the latest statistics. Other construction activity appeared on the whole to have bottomed out and might have begun to trend higher. Anecdotal reports suggested a pickup in the volume of commercial property transactions, though apparently not yet in the prices of commercial properties in most areas, and rising construction outlays were anticipated for commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities as economic activity continued to expand. Office construction was likely to remain generally depressed as excess capacity continued to be absorbed, but such construction might not decline further. Members also anticipated appreciable further growth in business spending for equipment, notably for the purpose of enhancing productivity in an environment of strong competitive pressures; concurrently, spending to expand capacity seemed likely to remain relatively limited unless consumer spending gathered more momentum in coming quarters than was now anticipated. On balance, business fixed investment was expected to continue to provide considerable support to the economic expansion. ']
