[' Total retail sales were little changed in real terms in July and August. Despite the recent sluggishness, however, real spending for goods in July and August was appreciably above the level in the second quarter. In addition, real expenditures for services had grown rapidly in July; this reflected both high energy consumption associated with unusually hot weather and robust spending for other services. The persistence of hot weather through August suggested that spending on energy services continued at a high level for that month. After a slight decline in July, housing starts rose substantially in August. Single-family starts accounted for all of the August increase, as multifamily starts fell further and continued to hover around their thirty-year low. ']
