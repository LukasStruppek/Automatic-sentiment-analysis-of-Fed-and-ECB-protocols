[' Total nonfarm payroll employment edged lower in August after a sizable gain in July. Hiring in the service-producing sectors, especially in health and business services, was down in August from the pace of recent months, and more jobs were lost in manufacturing. Construction employment also moved lower, retracing part of the July increase. On the other hand, the average workweek rose to a relatively high level in August, and as a result, aggregate hours worked by production or nonsupervisory workers were significantly above the second-quarter average. The civilian unemployment rate declined to 6.7 percent. ']
