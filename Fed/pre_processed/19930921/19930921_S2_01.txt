[' The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested moderate growth in economic activity and limited reductions in margins of unemployed labor and capital through next year. Fiscal restraint, uncertainty about other government policies, and slow growth of foreign industrial economies over the near term would act as a constraint on the economy. However, improving balance-sheet positions and credit supply conditions were lifting an unusual constraint on spending, and the lower interest rates would encourage further increases in consumer spending, housing construction, and business fixed investment. The continued slack in labor and product markets, coupled with some tempering of inflation expectations, was expected to foster further reductions in wage and price inflation. ']
