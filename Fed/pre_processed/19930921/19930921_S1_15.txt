[" In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies depreciated on balance over the intermeeting period. Much of the dollar's decline reflected the strength of the mark and other European currencies, which was related in part to the unexpectedly slow pace of monetary easing in Germany and other European countries. Against the yen, the dollar rebounded early in the intermeeting period from the historical low that occurred around the time of the Committee's August meeting. The dollar was buoyed by joint central bank sales of yen against the dollar and by the accompanying public statement from the U.S. Treasury that was seen by market participants as signaling a new attitude toward any further appreciation of the yen. On September 21, the dollar rose sharply on news that President Yeltsin had dissolved the Russian Parliament. "]
