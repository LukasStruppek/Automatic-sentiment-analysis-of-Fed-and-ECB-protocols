[' Business inventories contracted sharply in July after changing little in June. The bulk of the July decline occurred in the retail sector and reflected drawdowns in inventories at automobile dealerships. Non-auto retail inventories edged down in July; with sales flat, the ratio of non-auto inventories to sales remained near the high end of the range for the past several years. In the wholesale trade sector, stocks were trimmed somewhat further in July, but the inventory-to-sales ratio remained at the midpoint of its range over the past three years. Manufacturing stocks were unchanged in July after a small reduction in June. With shipments down in July owing to weak shipments of aircraft and motor vehicles, the stocks-to-sales ratio rebounded in July but was still at a low level. ']
