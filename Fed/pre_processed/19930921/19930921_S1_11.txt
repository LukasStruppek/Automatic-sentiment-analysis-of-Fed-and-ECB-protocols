[' Producer prices of finished goods fell sharply further in August; higher prices for consumer foods were more than offset by lower prices for the energy and the nonfood, non-energy components of the index. For finished goods other than food and energy, producer prices increased over the twelve months ended in August by a considerably smaller amount than in the previous twelve-month period. Consumer prices rose a little faster in August than in July, with an increase in food prices counterbalancing a decline in prices of consumer energy goods. For nonfood, non-energy items, consumer prices advanced over the twelve months ended in August by an amount comparable to that recorded for the twelve months ended in August 1992. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers were up in August after little change on balance in June and July; the rise reflected in part overtime earnings in manufacturing. Over the twelve months ended in August, this measure of earnings increased by about the same amount as in the previous twelve-month period. ']
