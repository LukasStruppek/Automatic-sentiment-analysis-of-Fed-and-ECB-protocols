[' In other comments, members referred to a number of financial developments that had favorable implications for sustained economic expansion. Business firms and consumers had made substantial progress in strengthening their balance sheets, and while the process of adjusting balance sheets evidently was still under way, the material improvement accomplished thus far had diminished financial risks and constraints on spending. Banking institutions had bolstered their capital positions and were in a better position to accommodate increases in loan demand. Bond and stock markets had exhibited considerable strength. In this connection, however, a few members commented on the apparently growing concern in financial markets that current equity prices were high relative to earnings and dividends. A correction in U.S. equity markets could trigger cumulative selling, especially by mutual funds, which had garnered substantial new investors, some of whom might not fully appreciate the risks of their new assets relative to deposits. On the positive side, there were good reasons for optimism on the trajectory of business profits in an environment of low inflation and moderate growth. Moreover, some managers of mutual funds reportedly were taking steps to strengthen the liquidity of their portfolios, and members reported on efforts to improve individual investor awareness of the risks of equity investments.
