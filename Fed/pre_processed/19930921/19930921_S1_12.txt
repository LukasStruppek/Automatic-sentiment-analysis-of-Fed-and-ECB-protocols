[" At its meeting on August 17, 1993, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that, in contrast to the two previous directives, did not include a tilt toward possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and little net change in M3 over the balance of the third quarter. "]
