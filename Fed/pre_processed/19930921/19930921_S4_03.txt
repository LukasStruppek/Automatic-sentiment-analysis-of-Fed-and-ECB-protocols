[' In considering possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, all of the members endorsed a proposal to retain a symmetrical directive. While current economic uncertainties were mirrored in uncertainties about the future course of monetary policy, the members agreed that developments in the period until the next meeting in mid-November were not likely to call for any adjustment to policy. Beyond the nearer term, however, both the timing and, in the view of at least some members, the direction of the next policy change could not be foreseen at this time. While they did not see convincing evidence that monetary policy was overly stimulative at this point, some members were concerned the current stance, as reflected in short-term interest rates, was quite accommodative and probably would need to be firmed at some point. These members stressed the need to remain especially alert to potential inflationary developments against the background of persisting inflationary expectations and uncertain progress toward price stability. Other members, while sharing this concern to an extent, gave some weight to the possibility that the expansion might remain quite sluggish for a period; under the circumstances, they foresaw the need to maintain an accommodative policy posture and could not rule out the possibility that the next policy move might have to be toward greater monetary stimulus.
