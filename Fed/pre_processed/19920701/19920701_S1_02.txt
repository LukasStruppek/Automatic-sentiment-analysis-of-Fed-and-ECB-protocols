Most interest rates have changed little since the Committee meeting on May 19. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined further over the intermeeting period. M2 and M3 changed little in May and appear to have contracted in June; both retail and large denomination time deposits continued to run off rapidly. Through June, expansion of the two aggregates was somewhat below the lower ends of the ranges established by the Committee for the year.
