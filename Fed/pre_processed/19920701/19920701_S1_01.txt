The information reviewed at this meeting continues to suggest that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased somewhat further in May, but a surge in job seekers led to a sizable rise in the civilian unemployment rate to 7.5 percent. Industrial production rose appreciably further in May, partly reflecting continued recovery in motor vehicle assemblies. Growth in consumer spending has slackened after a sharp advance earlier this year. Although sales of new homes declined in May, single-family housing starts rebounded to a level close to the first-quarter pace. Recent data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods indicate appreciable increases in outlays for business equipment, and the trend of building contracts points to some slowing of the decline in nonresidential construction. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit increased in April and was sustantially above its average rate in the first quarter. Incoming data on retail prices and labor costs suggest that inflation is slowing.
