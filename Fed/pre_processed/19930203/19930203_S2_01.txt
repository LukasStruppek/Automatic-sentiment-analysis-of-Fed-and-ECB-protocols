[' The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity would expand over the year ahead at a pace that would be sufficient to reduce gradually margins of unemployed labor and capital. Recent declines in long-term interest rates and more optimistic attitudes on the part of businesses and households were expected to support further solid gains in business fixed investment and in homebuying. Continuing progress in reducing debt service burdens and a gradual lessening of concerns regarding job security were projected to foster an expansion of consumer spending a shade faster than the growth in incomes. Export demand would be damped for some period of time by the appreciation of the dollar since mid-1992, but an anticipated pickup in growth abroad later this year would begin to counteract the effects of the higher dollar. Against the background of considerable uncertainties associated with still unannounced fiscal policy initiatives, the staff retained for this forecast the assumption contained in several previous forecasts that fiscal policy would remain mildly restrictive, largely because of declining defense outlays. The persisting slack in resource utilization over the forecast horizon was expected to be associated with some additional progress in reducing inflation. ']
