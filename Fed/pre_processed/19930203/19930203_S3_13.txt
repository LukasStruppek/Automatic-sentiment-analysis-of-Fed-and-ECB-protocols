[" The members recognized that the strength of the factors that were expected to continue to depress broad money growth in relation to income in 1993 was still subject to considerable uncertainty, and this implied the need for flexibility in assessing the implications of money growth relative to the Committee's ranges. Should the factors influencing the behavior of the broad aggregates persist in holding down money growth to the extent seen in 1992, expansion of M2 and M3 in the lower portion of their reduced ranges would be consistent with considerable further growth in nominal spending. Indeed, a shortfall from the reduced ranges could not be ruled out, and one member felt that the potential for such a development warranted consideration of a somewhat larger reduction in the M2 range; such a reduction also would signal more clearly the Committee's commitment to price stability. On the other hand, the upper portions of the reduced ranges would still accommodate an ample provision of liquidity to support further economic expansion even if the growth of money and of income were to move toward an historically more normal alignment and velocity were to slow from its high rate of increase. In one view, widening the tentative M2 range by reducing its lower limit while retaining its upper limit would help the Committee to convey its views regarding the potential for a continuing but acceptable sluggishness in M2 growth while leaving room for the possibility of faster M2 expansion should changing circumstances foster diminishing strength in velocity. Another member expressed a preference for narrowing the tentative range by lowering only its upper limit as a means of signaling the Committee's intent to resist both inflationary and recessionary developments. In light of the uncertainties that were involved, the informational content of the aggregates probably had diminished and in any event the Committee would need to continue to evaluate monetary growth developments in the context of a careful assessment of a wide variety of other financial, economic, and price developments. In this connection, one member observed that the uncertainties were of such a magnitude that, while plausible arguments could be made for a number of different ranges, retention of the tentative ranges would be appropriate in light of the Committee's willingness to review the ranges in the event that unanticipated developments were to unfold.
