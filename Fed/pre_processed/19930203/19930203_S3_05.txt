[' The growth in consumer incomes in turn was likely to depend importantly on the expansion in business investment spending, and members cited a number of factors that were expected to provide a favorable setting for sustained momentum in such spending over the year ahead. These included the strengthening of final demands, the recent declines in intermediate -and long-term interest rates, the greater leeway for financial intermediaries to increase their lending to businesses, and a continuing desire by business firms to improve their operating efficiencies. Commercial construction activity, however, was likely to remain quite sluggish. There were indications that commercial real estate values had stabilized in a number of areas, but at low levels, and given the persistence of marked imbalances in numerous real estate markets that were the result of several years of overbuilding, a significant rebound in commercial building activity for the nation as a whole might well be several years away. The outlook for housing construction was much more promising. Against the background of a general upswing in consumer confidence and the improved balance sheets of many households, the declines that had occurred in mortgage interest rates had fostered a marked strengthening in the demand for single-family housing as evidenced by reports from many parts of the country as well as the overall statistics on housing. On the basis of these developments, the members anticipated a continuing impetus to the economic expansion from housing construction and from related industries over the year ahead. In addition, the current indications of generally lean business inventories, associated in part with strong final demands over the past several months, suggested that the prospects for further gains in overall spending were likely to stimulate efforts by business firms to build up inventories over the quarters ahead.
