[" At this meeting the Committee discussed a preliminary report of a subcommittee that had been established to examine various issues relating to the release of information about Committee meetings and decisions. All of the members agreed that the Committee should keep the public as fully informed as possible about its monetary policy decisions and their rationale. Such information could reduce uncertainty about the stance of policy and about the factors the Committee takes into account in reaching its decisions. However, release of information should not be allowed to compromise the overriding objective of making and implementing the best possible decisions. In that regard, the Committee noted that its deliberative process requires a free flow of ideas, including the ability to advance or question hypotheses, to speculate on alternative outcomes, and to change opinions in response to the views expressed by other members. The members also needed to feel at liberty during meetings to use a wide array of information that is obtained on a confidential basis; at least some of that information would no longer be provided to the Committee if there were a risk of public disclosure. Moreover, the Committee wanted to give further consideration to the risk that the adoption of a different schedule for releasing information about policy decisions might have the effect, in difficult circumstances, of reducing its willingness to make needed policy adjustments promptly. No decisions were made at this meeting concerning various options for apprising the public more fully or promptly of the Committee's actions, and it was understood that the subcommittee would continue to study the matter.
