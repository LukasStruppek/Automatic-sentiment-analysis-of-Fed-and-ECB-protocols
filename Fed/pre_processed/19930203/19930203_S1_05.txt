[' Total nonfarm payroll employment registered a small increase in December for the fourth consecutive month. Service industries, notably business and health services, and retail trade accounted for nearly all of the rise in jobs. Manufacturing and construction payrolls changed little, and government employment fell as temporary election workers were dropped from payrolls. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent, almost 1/2 percentage point below its mid-year peak but slightly above its level at the beginning of the year. ']
