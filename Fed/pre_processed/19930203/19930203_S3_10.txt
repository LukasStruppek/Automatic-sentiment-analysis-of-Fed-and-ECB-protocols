[" In the event, the velocities of M2 and M3 had increased appreciably in the second half of 1992 and analysis of the factors behind this development suggested further increases in the year ahead. Consequently, in the Committee's discussion, which tended to focus on M2, all the members indicated that they could support a proposal to lower the tentative ranges for growth of the broad monetary aggregates by one-half percentage point for 1993. At the same time, a number of members indicated that they preferred somewhat different ranges including the retention of the tentative ranges, lowering the ranges by more than the proposal, and widening or narrowing them. All the members were in firm agreement that the purpose of the proposed reductions was not to signal or implement any change in monetary policy or to convey any intention to move away from the Committee's commitment to maximum sustainable economic expansion. Rather, the reductions were motivated by the persistence of marked shortfalls in the growth of M2 and M3 from their historical relationships with various measures of aggregate economic performance; those shortfalls appeared to be the technical result of forces that are altering the relationship between money and income. Members of the Committee urged that the Board's report to Congress and the Chairman's accompanying testimony make clear the reasons for the unusual behavior of money and its consequences for the Committee's choice of ranges.
