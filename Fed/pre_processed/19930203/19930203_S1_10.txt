[' The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened slightly in November. For October and November together, however, the deficit narrowed a little from its average rate in the third quarter, as the value of exports rose more than the value of imports. Most of the increase in exports was in capital goods, both machinery and aircraft, and in consumer goods. Passenger cars accounted for a considerable part of the rise in imports, while the inflow of consumer goods eased from the very strong pace of the third quarter. Recent indicators suggested that economic activity had remained weak in the major foreign industrial countries and that unemployment rates had increased further in most of those countries. The recovery in Canada appeared to be continuing, but the downturn in western Germany and Japan evidently had persisted into the fourth quarter. ']
