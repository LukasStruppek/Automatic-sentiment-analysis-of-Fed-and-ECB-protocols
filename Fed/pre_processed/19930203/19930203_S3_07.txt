[" Turning to the outlook for fiscal policy, members were encouraged by the prospect that the President would soon propose a program that would produce substantial reductions in the federal deficit over the years ahead. Such a deficit-reduction program, if deemed credible, could result in lower intermediate- and long-term interest rates than would otherwise prevail--even before the program was enacted--with very positive implications for interest-sensitive expenditures. For the nearer term, the President was expected to announce some modest fiscal stimulus relative to what was currently in train. However, the specifics of the President's proposals were not yet known and there was little current basis on which to judge prospective public and Congressional reactions. Members emphasized the critical need for long-term deficit reduction, and some expressed concern about the adverse effects on financial markets if fiscal stimulus measures were to be enacted for the short run without the assurance of further legislation to cut federal deficits over time.
