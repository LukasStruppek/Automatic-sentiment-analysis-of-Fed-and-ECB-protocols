[' Despite tepid job growth, retail sales had strengthened markedly during the closing months of 1992, and several members commented that such sales had continued to display surprising vigor in some parts of the country during the early weeks of 1993. Apart from the improvement in consumer sentiment, other favorable factors cited with regard to the outlook for consumer spending included lower debt-service burdens and the capital gains or enhanced cash flows now being realized as sales of homes picked up and mortgage refinancings again strengthened. Some members nonetheless expressed a degree of concern about the sustainability of the gains in consumer spending unless there were faster growth in employment and income to support such spending. Announcements by prominent firms of cutbacks in their workforces had continued into the new year, and while job gains at other firms, especially smaller ones, were contributing to modest net growth in overall employment, the publicity surrounding the persisting job cutbacks and a tendency for many new jobs to be lower-paying added an element of caution to the outlook for consumer expenditures. On balance, with the measured saving rate already at a low level, though an argument could be made that the actual rate was somewhat higher than indicated by the currently published data, consumer spending seemed likely to expand about in line with the growth in consumer incomes over the coming year.
