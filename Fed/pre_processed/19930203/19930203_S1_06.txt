[' Industrial production advanced further in December and was up considerably over the fourth quarter as a whole. Motor vehicle assemblies rose sharply during the quarter; strong gains also were registered in business equipment, partly reflecting a further jump in output of computers, and in nondurable consumer goods. By contrast, the production of durable consumer goods other than motor vehicles was lower on balance after changing little over the third quarter, and the output of defense and space equipment remained on a downward trend. Total utilization of industrial capacity increased significantly in the fourth quarter and for the year as a whole. ']
