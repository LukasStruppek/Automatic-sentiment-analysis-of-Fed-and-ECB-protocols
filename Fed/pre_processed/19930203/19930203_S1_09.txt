[' Business inventories expanded moderately in November as a sizable drop in manufacturing inventories was more than offset by increases in wholesale and retail inventories. At the manufacturing level, the drawdown of stocks was associated with strong shipments of durable goods, and inventory-to-shipments ratios in most industries were at or near the bottom of their recent ranges. In the wholesale sector, sizable inventory increases were reported in November for a second straight month; most of the buildup was limited to machinery, motor vehicles, and miscellaneous nondurable goods. With stocks rising in line with sales since September, the stock-to-sales ratio in wholesaling remained at the low end of its range over the past year. Retail inventories increased moderately further in November; the inventory-to-sales ratio for the sector was slightly below its average for previous months of the year. ']
