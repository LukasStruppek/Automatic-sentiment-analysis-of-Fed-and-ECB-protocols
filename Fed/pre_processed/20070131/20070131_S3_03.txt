In their discussion of the major sectors of the economy, participants noted that the housing market showed tentative signs of stabilization in most regions. Anecdotal reports presented a mixed picture, with fairly firm home sales in some areas but continuing decline in others. But aggregate data indicated that home sales, which had been essentially flat since mid-year, had risen a bit during the fourth quarter. Mortgage applications for home purchases had risen from their low levels of last summer. Sentiment among homebuilders reportedly had improved in the past few months, and the inventory of new homes for sale had fallen. Nonetheless, participants noted that inventories remained elevated and needed to be worked down before growth in this sector resumed. Unseasonably warm weather so far this winter complicated the interpretation of recent data, but participants were optimistic that the risk of a much larger contraction in housing had diminished and that the drag on growth from the housing sector would ease later this year.
