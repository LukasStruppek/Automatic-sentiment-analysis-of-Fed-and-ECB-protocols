The FOMC's decision at the December meeting to leave its target for the federal funds rate unchanged and to retain the language in the statement regarding the risks to inflation appeared to match investors' expectations. However, the characterization of recent economic growth was reportedly interpreted by market participants as suggesting a slight softening in the Committee's outlook for the expansion. As a result, the expected path of the federal funds rate beyond the near term edged down. The subsequent release of the minutes from the meeting elicited little market reaction. Investors' outlook for economic activity firmed over the intermeeting period, as economic data releases came in stronger than expected and oil prices declined notably. As a result, investors markedly reduced the extent of policy easing anticipated over coming quarters, and yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury coupon securities rose. Measures of inflation compensation were little changed on net. Spreads of investment-grade corporate bond yields over those of comparable-maturity Treasury securities moved down a bit, while those of speculative-grade issues declined significantly more. Broad equity indexes edged higher. The foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies rose, on balance, particularly versus the yen.
