In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted that the economic information received since the last meeting pointed to a somewhat more favorable outlook regarding both inflation and economic growth than they had earlier anticipated. Incoming data suggesting a leveling out in housing demand and strength in consumer spending outside the housing sector supported the view that the expansion remained resilient despite the appreciable decline in housing activity and recent weakness in the manufacturing sector. Over the next several quarters, economic activity would likely advance at a pace at or modestly below the economy's trend rate of growth. Thereafter, growth was likely to return to around its trend rate, which several participants viewed as likely to be higher than the staff's estimate. Favorable readings on core inflation and lower energy prices had also improved the odds that inflation pressures would diminish. However, it was noted that the prevailing level of inflation was uncomfortably high, and resource utilization was elevated. The upside risks to inflation remained the Committee's predominant concern.
