[' In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee sets its long-run ranges for the money and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members provided individual projections of the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 1998 and 1999. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP for 1998 as a whole had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/4 percent, which implied some moderation over the second half from staff estimates at the time of this meeting of the average rate of growth in the first and second quarters; for 1999 the forecasts pointed to moderate growth and were centered on a range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent. These projected rates of economic growth were accompanied by a very slight rise in the civilian rate of unemployment over the next 18 months to still quite low rates centering on 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999. With regard to the growth of nominal GDP, most of the forecasts were in ranges of 4-1/2 to 5 percent for 1998 and 4-1/4 to 5 percent for 1999. Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, indicated a slightly faster rise over the second half of this year and in 1999, largely because of expectations that the plunge in energy prices earlier in the year would not be repeated. Specifically, the projections converged on CPI inflation rates of 1-3/4 to 2 percent for 1998 as a whole and 2 to 2-1/2 per cent in 1999. ']
