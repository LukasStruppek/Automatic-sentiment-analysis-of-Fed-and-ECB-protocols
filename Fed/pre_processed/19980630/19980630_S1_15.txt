[" Growth of M2 and M3 slowed in the second quarter but remained fairly robust. Households accumulated unusually large deposit balances to make hefty nonwithheld tax payments in April, and these balances ran off in May as tax checks cleared; averaging through these gyrations, the expansion of the broad aggregates slowed on balance over April and May, and preliminary data suggest further slowing in June. The growth of M3 remained a little faster than that of M2, reflecting the further progress made by institution-only money market funds in attracting corporate cash-management business. For the year through June, both aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's ranges for the year. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have moderated somewhat after picking up earlier in the year; the moderation evidently reflected some slowing in the growth of business and household borrowing as well as paydowns of federal debt made possible by robust tax revenues.
