[' Consumer prices advanced at a slightly faster rate in May as an upturn in energy prices and a large increase in food prices more than offset a slower rate of increase in the prices of nonfood, non- energy items. Core consumer prices accelerated during the three months ended in May, largely reflecting higher tobacco prices and shelter costs. Nonetheless, core consumer prices rose less over the twelve months ended in May than they had over the previous twelve months. At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy continued to rise at a subdued rate in May. For the twelve months ended in May, core producer prices rose by a small amount after having changed little in the year-earlier period. At the intermediate level, core producer prices edged down in May and were little changed on net over the twelve months ended in May. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased at a slightly faster rate on balance over April and May. Measured on a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings accelerated further in the year ended in May. The largest gains were in business services and finance, insurance, and real estate, but marked acceleration also was evident in wholesale and retail trade. By contrast, gains in manufacturing had changed little over the past three years. ']
