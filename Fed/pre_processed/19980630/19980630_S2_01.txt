[' The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that economic activity would expand more slowly over the projection period than it had in recent years. Moderation in business inventory investment would damp domestic production as inventory accumulation was brought into better balance with the expected more moderate trajectory of final sales. In addition, reduced growth of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the sizable earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were anticipated to place substantial restraint on the demand for U.S. exports and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products. The staff analysis suggested that the prospective gains in income coupled with the run-up that had occurred in household wealth would support further brisk, though gradually diminishing, increases in consumer spending. Housing demand was expected to remain at a generally high level in the context of the persisting favorable cash flow affordability of home ownership, though the slower income growth anticipated over the projection period would damp homebuilding somewhat. Growth in business fixed investment would gradually moderate from the vigorous pace of the first half of the year in response to smaller increases in business sales and profits. Pressures on labor resources were likely to diminish somewhat as the expansion of economic activity slowed, but underlying inflation was expected to pick up gradually as gains in compensation increasingly outpaced improvements in productivity.
