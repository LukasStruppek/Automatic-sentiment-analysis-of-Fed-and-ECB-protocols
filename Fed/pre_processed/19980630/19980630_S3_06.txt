[" With regard to the external sector of the economy, the recent deterioration of conditions in Japan and several emerging economies in Asia and the related effects on other countries around the world were adding significantly to the uncertainties facing the U.S. economy. Members commented that it was too soon to judge the eventual extent and duration of the turmoil in Asia and its spillover to other nations, but several suggested that the consequences were likely to be more severe and longer lasting than they had anticipated earlier. Moreover, there seemed to be a very small but growing possibility of marked and spreading weakness that might have a more major effect on U.S. financial markets and the U.S. economy. One key to an improvement in the outlook for Asia was the adoption of appropriate policies by Japan, but very difficult political as well as economic problems clearly were involved for that nation and their resolution might well require an extended period of internal deliberations. From the standpoint of the United States, the Asian crisis and its repercussions around the world obviously were deepening the nation's trade deficit, but other effects such as those on U.S. interest rates and prices in world commodity markets, notably oil, were boosting domestic demand and tended to have a moderating near-term influence on inflation.
