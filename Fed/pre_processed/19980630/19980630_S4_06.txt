[' Mr. Jordan dissented because he believed that the unsustainably rapid growth of domestic demand--fueled by the acceleration of money and credit growth in the past year--was reflected in the recent sharp increase in imports and rising trade deficits. As U.S. output growth slows significantly from the rapid pace of 1997 and early 1998, it will be essential that domestic demand also slow. The very welcome progress toward eliminating inflation in recent years has contributed to the outstanding performance of the economy. Allowing domestic demand to continue to exceed domestic production would run the risk that corrosive effects of rising inflation would undermine future growth prospects. Furthermore, the resultant trade and current account deficits would have to be matched by ever larger inflows of foreign capital. Modest monetary restraint at this time might prevent either the buildup of inflationary imbalances that would eventually necessitate future policy restraint or unsustainable capital flows. In either case an economic contraction might become unavoidable. ']
