[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened further in April, as the value of exports declined more than that of imports. Exports of aircraft and parts dropped sharply from the first-quarter level, and exports of industrial supplies decreased by lesser amounts. Most of the decline in imports was in capital goods and automotive products. Recent information suggested a mixed economic performance among the major foreign industrial countries. Economic activity in Japan contracted sharply in the first quarter after declining slightly in the fourth quarter, and many other economies in Asia remained quite weak. The Asian crises held down exports of the major European countries, partly offsetting the influence of strong domestic demand. ']
