[' Nonfarm payroll employment registered substantial increases in April and May despite further job losses in manufacturing. Construction payrolls declined in May, but they were up sharply on balance over the April-May period following substantial gains earlier in the year. Employment increases in service-producing industries, notably business services and retail and wholesale trade, continued to be robust. The civilian unemployment rate stayed at 4.3 percent in May, and initial claims for unemployment insurance remained low through mid-June, after taking into account the onset of layoffs associated with the strike at General Motors.
