[' In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates that it had established in February for 1998 and also decided on tentative ranges for those aggregates in 1999. The current ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998 were unchanged from the ranges for other recent years and included expansion of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3. An unchanged range of 3 to 7 percent also was set in February for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt in 1998. ']
