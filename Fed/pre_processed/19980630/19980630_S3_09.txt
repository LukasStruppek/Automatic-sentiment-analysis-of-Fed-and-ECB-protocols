[" All the members favored or could support the retention of the current ranges for this year and their extension on a provisional basis to 1999. They took note of a staff projection that indicated that, given the Committee's expectations for the performance of the economy and prices and assuming no major changes in interest rates, growth of M2 and M3 probably would exceed the current ranges in 1998 and decline to a little below the upper end of those ranges in 1999. Both M2 and M3 had grown unusually quickly relative to spending in the first half of the year. The staff analysis suggested that some of the forces that might have been responsible for this decline in velocity would abate, and the projections anticipated that the velocity of M2 would be roughly in line with historical experience prior to the early 1990s, as it had been, on balance, for several years.
