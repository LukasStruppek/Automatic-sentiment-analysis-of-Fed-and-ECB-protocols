[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, the members generally agreed that the expansion in economic activity was likely to be relatively moderate over coming quarters, and that such growth would be consistent with some limited increase in inflation from the current unusually low level. The accumulation of business inventories, which until recently had added substantially to economic growth, was expected to continue at a much lower and more sustainable pace. Moreover, the effects on the U.S. trade balance of the appreciated value of the dollar and of economic weakness in several of the nation's trading partners probably would hold down increases in domestic output in coming quarters. Many of the members commented, however, that the already substantial risks surrounding the economic outlook had increased on both sides of their forecasts. On the downside, the greater risks focused on potential developments in Asia. Financial and economic conditions in Asia had deteriorated in recent months, and the members could not rule out the possible emergence of even greater financial turmoil and economic weakness in that part of the world that could spill over to other countries including the United States. On the upside, in the absence of strongly retarding effects from developments in Asia, persistent strength in domestic final demand might well add to inflationary pressures. Indeed, there were signs of modestly rising inflation in some recent measures of prices, though the rate of inflation was still relatively subdued. "]
