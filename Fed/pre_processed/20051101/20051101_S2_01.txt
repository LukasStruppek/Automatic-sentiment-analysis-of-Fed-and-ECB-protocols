In the forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff continued to project moderate economic growth for the second half of 2005. Output growth was expected to pick up in 2006, as the boost from hurricane-related rebuilding activity more than offset the effects of somewhat tighter financial conditions, and then slow in 2007, as the impetus from rebuilding waned. The near-term forecast again entailed a marked downshift in headline inflation as energy prices fall back consistent with readings from futures markets. Favorable incoming data led the staff to reduce its forecast for near-term core inflation a bit. The outlook continued to be for core inflation to pick up modestly over coming quarters owing to the lagged effects of higher energy prices but then to return to near current levels in 2007 primarily as the result of the restraining influence of falling energy prices.
