Hurricane Rita caused further disruption to energy production in the Gulf area, which had not yet fully recovered from Hurricane Katrina. Energy production in October was still below pre-hurricane levels, although progress had been made in reopening shut-down energy facilities. Rising imports, along with more-subdued consumption of gasoline and other petroleum products, helped to offset the effect on energy prices of some of the output losses in refined products. In addition, to address the low level of gasoline inventories and more-immediate retail demands, domestic refiners sharply increased the share of gasoline in their output of total refined product. Wholesale and retail gasoline prices spiked soon after Rita's landfall but had since declined to pre-hurricane levels. Spot prices for natural gas soared with the hurricanes and remained at elevated levels.
