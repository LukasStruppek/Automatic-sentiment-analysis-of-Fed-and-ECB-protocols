Real consumer spending increased at a moderate rate in the third quarter as a whole, although it declined in August and September after having risen substantially earlier in the summer. The softening in spending of late reflected in part the diminishing boost to light vehicle sales from manufacturers' programs offering employee discounts to nonemployees. Spending on other goods and services was also sluggish, likely because of the direct effects of the dislocation of households by the hurricanes, high energy prices, and falling consumer confidence. Consumer sentiment in October, as measured by both the Michigan Survey and the Conference Board's indicator, dropped a little further after plunging in September. The personal saving rate remained slightly negative in September.
