The U.S. international trade deficit widened somewhat in August, as a surge in imports of goods and services was partially offset by a sizable gain in exports. The growth in imports reflected both a marked increase in oil imports and a rise in nonoil goods; imports of services were little changed. The increase in exports was driven by higher merchandise exports, although exports of services also advanced a bit. GDP growth in foreign industrial economies appeared to have continued at a moderate pace in the third quarter.
