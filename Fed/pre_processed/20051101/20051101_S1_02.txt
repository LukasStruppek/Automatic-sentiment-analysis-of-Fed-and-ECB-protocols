The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy had a good deal of forward momentum in the third quarter. Although recent hurricanes caused considerable damage and disruption, particularly in the energy sector, economic activity outside the Gulf region appeared to have been well maintained. In September, hiring in other regions remained in line with its pace over the preceding twelve months, and excluding the estimated effects of the hurricanes and a strike by Boeing machinists, industrial production increased briskly. In addition, residential construction remained buoyant. Consumer spending, however, showed some signs of weakening. Although consumer spending was strong for the third quarter as a whole, it softened in September, and survey measures of consumer confidence slumped noticeably. Despite the large increase in consumer energy prices since midyear, core price inflation was restrained through September.
