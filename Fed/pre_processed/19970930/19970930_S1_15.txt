[" M2 expanded at a rapid pace in August and continued to grow at a still robust though diminished rate in September according to the limited data available for that month. The strength of M2 and also that of M3 was related at least in part to changes in the allocation of financial assets and liabilities rather than to the growth in spending; in particular, the volatility in the stock market evidently fostered a redirection of funds to M2 assets, among others, and included heavy inflows to the money market funds component of M2. For the year through August, M2 rose at a rate somewhat above the upper bound of the Committee's range. M3 grew at an exceptionally rapid rate over the summer months, with only few signs of moderation in September according to the partial data available for that month. Apart from the strength in its M2 components, the increase in this aggregate reflected bank substitution of large time deposits for foreign borrowings to finance credit growth and also reflected substantial inflows to institution-only money funds. For the year through August, M3 expanded at a rate well above the upper bound of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to increase at a relatively moderate rate in recent months. "]
