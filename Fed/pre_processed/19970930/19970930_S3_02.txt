[' With regard to the prospects for final demand in key sectors, members took note of the rebound in consumer expenditures after a sluggish second quarter. Solid gains in employment, incomes, and household net worth were seen as sustaining further robust expansion in consumer spending. In addition, members anticipated that continued further rapid expansion in investment expenditures by business firms for equipment and structures would provide strong underlying support for the economic expansion. High rates of return on investments in equipment, particularly for computers and communications equipment where prices were falling rapidly, coupled with ready financing from both internal cash flows and external sources were inducing firms to undertake large investment programs. Such investments would expand capacity, improve productivity, and lower costs of production. Anecdotal reports suggested a mixed picture in nonresidential real estate markets. In much of the country, commercial and office vacancies were declining from already low levels and lease rates were rising. Shortages of construction workers were said to be holding back construction in some areas, but in other parts of the country there were indications of some moderation in construction activity and of emerging overcapacity in some markets. The ready availability of financing was a supportive factor in the outlook for nonresidential construction. ']
