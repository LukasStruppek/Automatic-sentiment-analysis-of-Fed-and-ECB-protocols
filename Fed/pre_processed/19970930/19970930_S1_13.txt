[" Open market operations were directed throughout the inter-meeting period toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, and the federal funds rate averaged just slightly above the Committee's intended level of 5-1/2 percent. Most other interest rates in short-term markets were little changed over the period. Rates on longer-term obligations were down somewhat on balance, apparently reflecting a reassessment of the outlook for inflation by some market participants in the light of unexpectedly low inflation and other statistics released during the latter part of the period. The downward movement in long-term interest rates resulted in some further flattening of the slope of the yield curve and appeared consistent with an interpretation that market participants saw little likelihood of any tightening of monetary policy in coming months. Share prices in equity markets continued to display considerable volatility but increased appreciably further on balance over the intermeeting interval. "]
