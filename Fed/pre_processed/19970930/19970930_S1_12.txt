[' At its meeting on August 19, 1997, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate averaging about 5-1/2 percent. The directive included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions and a somewhat higher federal funds rate to reflect a consensus among the members that the economic risks remained biased toward higher inflation. Although the members did not see a high probability that likely developments would warrant a tightening of policy during the intermeeting interval, they continued to anticipate that the next policy move was more likely to be in the direction of some firming than toward some easing. The reserve market conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some slowing in the growth of M2 and M3 to more moderate rates over coming months. ']
