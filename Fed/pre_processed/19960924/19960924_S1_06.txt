[' Industrial production also advanced somewhat less rapidly on average in July and August after having recorded strong gains in the previous few months; slower growth was evident in mining and utilities as well as in manufacturing. Smaller increases in the output of motor vehicles and parts accounted for part of the slowdown in the expansion of the manufacturing sector in August; in addition, the output of consumer goods other than motor vehicles remained sluggish, and the production of construction supplies declined significantly after having surged in the second quarter. Elsewhere in manufacturing, business equipment, notably its office and computing component, continued its robust expansion over July and August, and defense and space equipment extended the upturn that began in the second quarter. The rate of utilization of total industrial capacity was unchanged on balance from June to August and remained at a relatively high level. ']
