[' Competitive pressures also were compelling firms to curb cost increases through improvements in their productivity performance. Widespread reports suggested major gains in productivity in numerous industries, induced in recent years by business restructuring and related activities and by large capital investments that had introduced increasingly productive equipment. Although currently available measures of productivity for the economy as a whole showed only weak gains, sectoral disaggregation of the data gave reasons to question the productivity measurements. Productivity had increased fairly sharply in manufacturing, and the slowdown in overall productivity since 1973 had been concentrated in the service areas of the economy. Indeed, measured productivity in noncorporate businesses--largely services--had displayed a negative trend for many years. This result was implausible and suggested considerable error in estimating output and prices for many services. Consequently, it was likely that actual productivity growth was higher than the current measures indicated. By the same token, the rate of price inflation was lower than had been reported, consistent with the findings of a number of studies of distortions in published price data. ']
