[' Total retail sales rose slightly over July and August after having declined substantially in June. Decreased outlays at food stores, gas stations, and furniture and appliance stores in August were a little more than offset by a sharp pickup in sales at general merchandisers, apparel stores, and outlets for durable goods other than furniture and appliances. Housing starts rebounded in August from a July drop and for the two months were about unchanged on average from their second-quarter level; however, permits for single- family housing were unchanged in August and had fallen from their second-quarter level. Sales of existing homes weakened in June and July. ']
