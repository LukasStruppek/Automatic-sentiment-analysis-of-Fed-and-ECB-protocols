[' In their comments about the outlook for inflation, members observed that the recent behavior of price inflation was a welcome though highly unusual development, given current pressures on resources. The statistical and anecdotal information provided evidence of increasingly tight labor markets that under similar conditions historically had been associated with considerable upward pressure on nominal labor compensation and, in turn, on prices. While wages, and probably total labor compensation, were rising more rapidly this year, the acceleration in the latter still appeared to be held down by worker insecurity and relatively subdued increases in the cost of benefits. Moreover, for a variety of reasons rising labor costs were not currently being passed through to prices, which by several key measures adjusted for their volatile food and energy components exhibited a steady or even a declining trend. Explanations tended to concentrate on the intense competition in many markets, which prevented firms from raising prices to absorb cost increases. ']
