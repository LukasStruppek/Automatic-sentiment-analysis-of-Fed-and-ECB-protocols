[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in July from its June level and also from its average rate for the second quarter. Despite one-time service payments related to the Olympics and larger inflows of imported oil, imports edged down in July from the sharply increased rate recorded for the second quarter; the latter largely reflected the strength of the U.S. economy during the first half of the year. Exports fell considerably more in July than did imports; in addition to decreased exports in such categories as consumer goods, aircraft and parts, automotive products, and other industrial supplies, part of the measured decline may have reflected residual seasonality in the data. Available information suggested that, on balance, the economies of the major foreign industrial countries had strengthened in recent months. In Japan, a mild second-quarter pause after very rapid first-quarter growth had been followed by renewed expansion. Economic activity in Germany had rebounded sharply in the second quarter from a first- quarter contraction, and further expansion appeared to be in train. Although economic growth had been sluggish in Canada and the United Kingdom in the second quarter, recent indicators suggested a pickup in activity in those countries as well. By contrast, France and Italy had experienced little, if any, growth since early in the year. ']
