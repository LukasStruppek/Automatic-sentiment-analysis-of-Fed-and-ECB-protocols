[' The implications for the inflation outlook were not clear- cut. The key question was how long the favorable price behavior would persist. Advances in productivity had boosted profit margins, and high margins were helpful in that they could absorb some portion of any cost increases for a time. However, many business contacts indicated that they would resist squeezes in profit margins, and continued acceleration in costs would eventually feed through to greater price inflation whatever the rate of productivity growth. The behavior of costs and the ability of businesses to pass along any greater increases over time would depend on the extent to which the expansion would slow and how much associated pressure there would be in labor and product markets. In this connection, some members observed that even if the expansion were to slow to a sustained pace around the rate of increase of the economys potential, price inflation could well trend at least modestly higher at current levels of resource utilization. Others did not disagree that the odds might be tilted marginally in that direction, but they continued to believe that a great deal of uncertainty surrounded the outlook for resource use and, in turn, the relationship between a given degree of pressure on resources and overall price changes. In sum, assuming economic growth generally in line with their forecasts, the critical question for some was when and how much inflation would rise; many others were not persuaded of the inevitability of such an outcome.
