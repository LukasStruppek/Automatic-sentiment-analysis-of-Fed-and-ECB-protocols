[" A differing view focused on the desirability of a prompt move toward restraint to curb what were seen as growing inflationary pressures in the economy. Tight labor markets were likely to exert continuing upward pressure on labor costs, barring unexpected weakness in the economy, and at some point those costs would begin to be passed through to prices. In the circumstances, it was important for policy to be forward-looking and to move promptly to head off intensifying inflationary pressures. Potentially, waiting could require more disruptive policy tightening actions later and could risk the credibility of the System's anti-inflation policy. "]
