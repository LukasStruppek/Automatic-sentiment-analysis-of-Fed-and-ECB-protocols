[' Consumer price inflation remained moderate on balance over July and August; declines in energy prices offset higher food prices. Excluding food and energy, consumer prices recorded a somewhat smaller advance over the twelve months ended in August than over the previous twelve months. Producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy were unchanged on net over July and August, and this index rose at a significantly slower pace over the twelve months ended in August than over the preceding twelve months. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers rebounded in August, more than offsetting a small July decline. Over the year ended in August, this measure of labor costs increased considerably more than it had over the previous year. ']
