[" In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies appreciated slightly over the intermeeting period. The dollar's rise reflected in part the increase in U.S. long-term interest rates over the period. Declines in market rates abroad, both short- and long-term, also contributed to the dollar's strengthening. In Japan, newly released data led market participants to lower their assessments of the strength of that country's economic expansion and of the prospects of any near-term increase in official interest rates. In Germany, a reduction by the Bundesbank in its repo rate in late August and subsequent statements by Bank officials regarding possible additional declines in official rates appeared to foster market expectations that monetary policy might be eased further.
