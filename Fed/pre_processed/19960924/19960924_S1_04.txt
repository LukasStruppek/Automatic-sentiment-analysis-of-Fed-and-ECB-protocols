[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity had moderated appreciably from an elevated second-quarter pace. Growth in consumer spending had slowed noticeably, and higher mortgage rates seemed to be exerting some modest restraint on housing demand. While business demand for durable equipment remained strong, spending on nonresidential structures had weakened a little. Business inventory accumulation appeared to have picked up, although the level of inventories remained modest in relation to sales. Employment and production had continued to post sizable gains in recent months, but the increases were somewhat below those recorded earlier in the year. Consumer price inflation, excluding its food and energy components, had edged lower this year despite somewhat larger increases in labor compensation. ']
