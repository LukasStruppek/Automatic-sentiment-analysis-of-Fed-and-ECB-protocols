 The information reviewed at the June 23-24 meeting suggested that the economy remained very weak, though declines in activity seemed to be lessening Employment was still falling, and manufacturers had cut production further in response to excess inventories and soft demand But the reductions in employment and industrial production had slowed somewhat, consumer spending appeared to be holding reasonably steady after shrinking in the second half of 2008, and sales and construction of single-family homes had apparently flattened out In addition, the recent declines in capital spending were smaller than those recorded earlier in the year Consumer price inflation was fairly quiescent in recent months, although the upturn in energy prices appeared likely to boost headline inflation in June
