[' With economic growth moderating and inflation quiescent, open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period. The federal funds rate averaged a little higher than the level expected with an unchanged policy stance, in part because of unexpectedly high demand for reserves in late July and early August. On balance, most other short-term market interest rates declined slightly, and intermediate- and long-term rates fell somewhat more, over the intermeeting period. In the days immediately following the meeting, rates rose sharply in response to incoming data, notably the employment report for June that market participants viewed as indicating increasing pressures on economic resources and labor costs. Subsequently, however, that rise was more than reversed when further data releases were interpreted as suggesting that the economic expansion might be slowing and that the upturn in labor compensation was mild. Equity prices also exhibited considerable volatility over the period since the Committee meeting on July 2-3, with major indexes of stock prices falling steeply through late July before recouping part to most of their losses in association with the bond market rally and favorable earnings reports.
