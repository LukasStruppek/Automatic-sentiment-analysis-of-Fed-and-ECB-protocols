[' In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, members observed that increases in prices had remained remarkably subdued for an extended period in relation to measures of resource utilization, notably the rate of unemployment. Such behavior differed markedly from the historical experience under similar circumstances. One factor tending to hold down prices has been highly competitive markets--throughout the nation and internationally as well--that made it very difficult for business firms to raise prices. Another key factor, though one whose importance might now be starting to diminish, was the persistence of comparatively small increases in labor compensation, which remained appreciably below earlier norms in relation to levels of unemployment. This development appeared to reflect worker concerns about job security in a period of major business restructuring and downsizing activities as well as substantially reduced increases in benefit costs, notably those relating to health care.
