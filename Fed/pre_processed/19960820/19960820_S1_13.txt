[' Growth of M2 and M3 moderated in July. Much of the slowdown in the expansion of M2 was associated with an unexpected decline in demand deposits, which had grown rapidly earlier in the year. With bank credit expanding sluggishly, the funding needs of banks were modest, and the slower growth of M2 showed through to M3. For the year through July, both aggregates were estimated to have increased at rates somewhat below the upper bounds of their respective ranges for the year. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt had been moderate on balance over recent months and had remained in the middle portion of its range. ']
