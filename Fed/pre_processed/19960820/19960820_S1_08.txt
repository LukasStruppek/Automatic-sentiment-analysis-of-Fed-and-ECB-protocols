[" Business inventories increased by a modest amount in June after having contracted in May. In manufacturing, inventories continued to run off in June, reducing the sector's stock-sales ratio to near its historical low. Wholesale trade stocks also fell in June, and the inventory-sales ratio was in the lower portion of its range over recent years. Retail inventories rose in June; larger stocks at automotive dealers more than accounted for the increase. The inventory-sales ratio for the sector as a whole edged higher but remained at a relatively low level. "]
