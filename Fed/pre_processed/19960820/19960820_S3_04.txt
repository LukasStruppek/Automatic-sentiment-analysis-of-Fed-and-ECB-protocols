[' In assessing whether a relatively favorable inflation performance was likely to continue, the members focused on a variety of issues. One was whether the expansion would moderate sufficiently to keep pressures on labor and other resources from intensifying. Another was whether a rate of unemployment in the vicinity of its current level would foster added wage pressures. Uncertainty also surrounded the extent to which further increases in labor compensation costs, should they materialize, would be passed through to higher prices. Improvements in productivity were likely to offset part of such increases, but how much remained an open question. In addition, profit margins were high, but the extent to which they might narrow to absorb increasing labor costs was difficult to predict. With regard to the outlook for wages, members observed that, though it was too early to reach a firm judgment, the acceleration of wage increases this year might well augur faster advances that were more in line with historical experience under essentially full employment conditions. Moreover, the tendency toward reduced increases in the costs of benefits might tend to dissipate, though some members commented that further economies in the provision of medical services might well be achievable for some period. On balance, the inflation risks in the outlook clearly seemed to be to the upside, with the potential for more inflation stemming from rising labor compensation costs augmented by a rise in the minimum wage and the prospect of higher food prices and perhaps energy prices over the next several quarters.
