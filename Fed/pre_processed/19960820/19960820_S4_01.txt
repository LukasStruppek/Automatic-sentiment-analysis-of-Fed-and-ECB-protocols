[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, members focused on indications that the economy already was slowing, perhaps by enough to limit pressures on resources, and they noted that broad statistical measures of prices and the anecdotal evidence did not suggest that a pickup in inflation was already under way. Consequently, all but one of the members supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. A number also commented that real interest rates were not unusually low, suggesting that any pickup in inflationary pressures, should that occur, would be modest and readily contained. One concern was that policy tightening at this point might generate an excessive reaction in financial markets, both because it was not generally expected and because it would represent a change in policy direction that might well lead to expectations of further policy tightening. Such a development could have serious adverse consequences for economic activity if the expansion was in fact already slowing to a more sustainable and less inflationary pace. These members therefore concluded that the prudent course at this point was to await further developments that would permit them to assess the possible need for some tightening with a higher degree of confidence. At the same time, it was emphasized that the Committee remained committed to a policy that would resist a rise in inflation; such a policy would entail moving in anticipation of greater price pressures and before they showed through to actual inflation. Accordingly, they also agreed on the desirability of a directive that remained biased toward possible tightening in the intermeeting period ahead. Such a directive would imply that any tightening should be implemented promptly if developments were perceived as pointing to rising inflation. For now, the Committee should remain particularly vigilant to incoming information bearing on the outlook for inflation. "]
