[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economic expansion had moderated somewhat recently. Growth in consumer spending appeared to be slowing, business purchases of equipment and structures were rising less vigorously, and higher mortgage rates were beginning to exert a restraining effect on housing construction. Business inventory accumulation had been quite modest, and production and employment were expanding less rapidly. Increases in labor compensation had been somewhat larger this year, but consumer price inflation, adjusted for food and energy prices, had remained on a fairly steady trend. ']
