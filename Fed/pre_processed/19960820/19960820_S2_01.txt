[" The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would slow to a rate around, or perhaps a little above, the economy's estimated growth potential. Consumer spending was projected to expand at a more moderate pace that would be in line with the projected increase in disposable income; the favorable effect of the earlier run-up in equity prices on household wealth and the generally ample availability of credit were expected to balance continuing consumer concerns about the adequacy of their savings and the restraining effect of high household debt burdens. Homebuilding was forecast to slow somewhat in response to the backup in residential mortgage rates but to remain at a relatively high level in the context of sustained income growth and the still-favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership. Business spending on equipment and structures was projected to grow less rapidly in light of the anticipated moderate growth of sales and profits. On balance, the external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period. Only modest fiscal restraint was anticipated over the forecast horizon. Inflation recently had been lifted by adverse developments in energy markets and was projected to remain above the levels of recent years, given the high level of resource utilization, the effects of tight grain supplies on food prices, and a noticeable step-up in labor compensation reinforced by the legislated rise in the federal minimum wage.
