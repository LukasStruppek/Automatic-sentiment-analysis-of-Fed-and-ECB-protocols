[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed in June, but on a quarterly average basis the deficit widened in the second quarter from its rate in the first quarter. In June, the value of exports declined slightly, but the value of imports dropped by a considerably larger amount from a relatively high rate in May. Available information suggested that economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to advance, but at an uneven pace; in Germany, activity rebounded from the contraction in the first quarter, while in Japan a considerable slowing of growth had occurred in the second quarter after very rapid expansion in the first quarter. Price inflation remained moderate on balance in June and July, with declines in energy prices essentially offsetting increases in food prices. Over a somewhat longer horizon, consumer prices for nonfood, non-energy items increased slightly less in the twelve months ended in July than in the previous twelve-month period. Producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy also increased more slowly in the twelve months ended in July. In contrast, growth in labor costs had picked up. The employment cost index for private industry workers advanced at a somewhat faster rate in the second quarter than in the first quarter or in the second half of 1995. Measured over the year ended in June, the index rose by a slightly larger amount than in the previous year. ']
