 The information reviewed at the December 15-16 meeting suggested that the recovery in economic activity was gaining momentum The pace of job losses slowed noticeably in recent months, and total hours worked increased in November; however, the unemployment rate remained quite elevated Industrial production sustained the broad-based expansion that began in the third quarter, but capacity utilization remained very low Consumer spending expanded solidly in October, reflecting in part a faster pace of motor vehicle sales Both light vehicle sales and total retail sales rose again in November Sales of new homes increased significantly in recent months, a development that, given the slow pace of construction, reduced the inventory of unsold new homes; sales of existing homes rose strongly Spending on equipment and software continued to stabilize, but investment in nonresidential structures declined further as conditions in nonresidential real estate markets remained poor Both imports and exports continued to recover from their depressed levels of earlier this year, and the US trade deficit in September and October was wider than in earlier months Although a jump in energy prices pushed up headline inflation somewhat, core consumer price inflation remained subdued
