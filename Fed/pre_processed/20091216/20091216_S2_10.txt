 Market participants largely anticipated the decisions by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at the November meeting to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and to retain the "extended period" language in the accompanying statement However, market participants took note of the Committee's explicit enumeration of the factors that were expected to continue to warrant this policy stance, and Eurodollar futures rates fell a bit on the release In contrast, the announcement that the Federal Reserve would purchase only about $175 billion of agency debt securities had not been generally anticipated Spreads on those securities widened a few basis points following the release, but declined, on net, over the intermeeting period Incoming economic data, while somewhat better than expected, seemed to have little net effect on interest rate expectations Indeed, the expected path of the federal funds rate shifted down somewhat over the intermeeting period Consistent with the decrease in short-term interest rates, yields on 2-year nominal off-the-run Treasury securities declined slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period In contrast, yields on nominal 10-year Treasury securities edged higher on balance Inflation compensation based on 5-year Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) increased, apparently owing in part to an announcement by the Treasury of a smaller-than-expected amount of issuance of TIPS next year Five-year inflation compensation five years ahead also rose, and was near the upper end of its range in recent years
