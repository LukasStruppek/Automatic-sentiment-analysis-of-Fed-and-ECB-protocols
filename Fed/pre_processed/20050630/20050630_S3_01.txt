In their discussion of current conditions and the economic outlook, many meeting participants noted that incoming data had been reassuring about the strength of the expansion. Following some softer readings earlier in the year, incoming spending and production data over the intermeeting period indicated that the expansion remained firm, led by residential and business investment. In addition, labor market conditions continued to strengthen gradually. The economy evidently had been resilient in the face of rising energy prices, and financial conditions remained accommodative, supporting growth going forward. Increases in core consumer prices had slowed of late, though underlying inflation was still seen by most meeting participants as likely to be modestly higher this year than last, impelled in part by the pass-through of a further rise in energy prices. However, the impetus to inflation from the prices of oil and other commodities was expected to wane, and long-term inflation expectations apparently remained well-anchored. With some limited remaining slack in labor markets likely damping growth in compensation, as well as further withdrawal of policy accommodation, core inflation was expected to remain contained.
