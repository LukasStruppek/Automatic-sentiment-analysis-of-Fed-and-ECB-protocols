Participants' views on the inflation outlook were mixed. Thus far in 2005, core consumer price inflation had been higher than most participants had expected at the start of the year, reflecting, at least in part, the pass-through effects of higher energy, commodity, and import prices. While such shocks could be expected to boost inflation temporarily, some participants expressed concern that, with policy still accommodative, the underlying pace of inflation might be in the process of stepping up, perhaps to a level that was at the upper end of the range that they viewed as compatible with the Committee's price stability objective. The degree of slack remaining in labor and resource markets was very uncertain, and unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector had moved notably higher in recent quarters. Trend unit labor costs could also be boosted by slower growth in structural productivity; while recent evidence was not conclusive, some participants thought the underlying pace of productivity growth might well fall back in coming quarters following the substantial gains seen in recent years. And with higher energy prices already eating into profit margins at firms outside the energy sector, increases in unit labor costs might be more likely to be passed through into prices.
