M2 edged lower over April and May as the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets rose further. Liquid deposits were especially weak, owing to the slow adjustment of yields paid on these deposits to increases in market rates. Despite the recent softness in M2, its velocity remained quite low relative to its historical relationships with opportunity cost. Bank credit decelerated sharply in April and May from rapid gains posted in the first quarter, as growth in both securities and loans fell.
