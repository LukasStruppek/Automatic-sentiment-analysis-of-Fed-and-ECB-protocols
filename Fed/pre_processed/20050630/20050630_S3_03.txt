In their comments about developments in key sectors of the economy, meeting participants noted that the fundamentals underlying household spending remained firm. With rising home and equity prices buoying household wealth, consumer expenditures continued to advance. Although the recent surge in energy prices was anticipated to impose some drag for a time, consumption spending was expected to grow about in line with income going forward, in an environment of further gradual improvements in labor markets. Increased speculative activity in housing markets was evident in some parts of the country, but robust demand for new homes owed in large part to the ongoing economic expansion and low long-term interest rates.
