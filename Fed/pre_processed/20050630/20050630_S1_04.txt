Averaging through a large gain in April and a more modest increase in May, growth in payroll employment was on par with that over the preceding six months. Payrolls expanded in line with their recent trends in the construction, transportation and utilities, and nonbusiness services sectors, while hiring in financial services slowed a bit, and the manufacturing sector posted further small losses of jobs. The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers edged up over the two-month period, helping to boost aggregate hours to the highest level since early 2001. The unemployment rate dipped to 5.1 percent in May. Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate moved up a bit, suggesting that the labor market had strengthened enough to attract some individuals back into the workforce. Survey indicators and the continued relatively low level of initial claims for unemployment insurance also supported the notion of continued improvement in the labor market.
