[' Consumer price inflation remained low in December, damped by a sizable further drop in energy prices and a small decline in food prices. Excluding food and energy items, an acceleration in the costs of services, notably medical care and shelter, provided a slight boost to core consumer price inflation in December. For the year as a whole, prices of core consumer items rose considerably less than in 1996, in part reflecting the effect of declining import prices. At the producer level, prices of all finished goods and of the core finished goods component declined further in December. For the year 1997, the core producer price index was little changed after a relatively small rise the previous year; the total index, weighed down by falling prices of finished food and energy items, partially reversed its 1996 increase. Prices also remained subdued at earlier stages of processing in 1997, with prices of crude materials falling substantially. Labor costs, as measured by the hourly compensation of private industry workers, increased at appreciably faster rates in the fourth quarter and for the year. ']
