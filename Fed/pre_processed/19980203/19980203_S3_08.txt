[' With regard to the outlook for inflation, members referred to widespread indications of increasingly tight labor markets and to statistical and anecdotal reports of faster increases in labor compensation. Labor cost increases in recent quarters had been especially rapid in a large segment of the service sector, where foreign competition was not a factor. Some members commented, however, that there were reasons to discount the sharp fourth-quarter increase in the employment cost index because to a large extent it was the result of nonrecurring developments in a limited number of industries. Despite the upward trend in labor compensation, gains in productivity clearly had kept increases in unit labor costs at a very modest level; and with unit nonlabor costs continuing to decline, overall unit cost increases had remained not far above zero. In these circumstances--and in the context of highly competitive conditions in many markets, declines in input prices and in the prices of many commodities, including oil--rising labor costs seemed to pose little risk of an upward impetus to inflation in coming months.
