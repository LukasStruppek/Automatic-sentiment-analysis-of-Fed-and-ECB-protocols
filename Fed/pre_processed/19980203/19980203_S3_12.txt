[" In their discussion of the ranges for M2 and M3, the members noted that the apparently greater predictability of velocity in recent years could not be counted on to persist, given changes in financial markets that had made investment alternatives more readily available. As a consequence, substantial uncertainty still surrounded projections of money growth consistent with the Committee's basic objectives for monetary policy. In this environment, the members did not see any firm basis for deviating from their recent practice of setting ranges that, assuming velocity behavior in line with historical patterns, would serve as benchmarks for monetary expansion consistent with longer-run price stability and a sustainable rate of real economic growth. The tentative ranges for 1998 had been derived in this way, and Committee members saw no reason to change those ranges at this time. Indeed, adjusting the ranges to center them more closely on growth rates deemed likely to be more consistent with the Committee's expectations for economic activity and prices could foster the misinterpretation that the Committee had become much more confident of the stability and predictability of velocity and was placing greater emphasis on M2 and M3 as gauges of the thrust of monetary policy. Several members commented, however, that the adoption of ranges centered on the Committee's expectations for growth of the monetary aggregates should be reconsidered in the future if the members were to become more confident about the relationship between the growth of the money and measures of aggregate economic performance. The Committee also agreed that the range for nonfinancial debt for 1998 should be left unchanged. The tentative range readily encompassed the pace seen as likely to be associated with the members' forecasts for economic activity and prices. "]
