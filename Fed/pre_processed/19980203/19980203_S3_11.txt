[" In reviewing the tentative ranges, the members took note of a staff projection indicating that, given the members' expectations for the performance of the economy and prices and assuming no major changes in interest rates, M2 likely would grow in 1998 in the upper half of its tentative range, and M3 somewhat above the top of its range. The staff analysis anticipated that the velocity of M2 would continue its recent pattern of relatively stable behavior that was more in line with historical experience than had been the case in the early 1990s. The velocity of M3 was projected to continue to decline at a somewhat faster rate than historical experience would indicate, reflecting the greater use by business firms of institution-only money market funds as a cash management tool and the needs of depository institutions for appreciable non-M2 funding to finance brisk loan growth. The staff projected that the debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors would grow around or perhaps slightly above the middle of its tentative range, reflecting the credit needs of businesses facing a weaker earnings outlook and larger merger-related retirements of equity.
