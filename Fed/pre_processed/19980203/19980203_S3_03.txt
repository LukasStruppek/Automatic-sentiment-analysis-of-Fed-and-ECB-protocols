[" The members stressed that the potential extent of the negative effects of developments in Asia on the nation's trade balance represented a key uncertainty in the economic outlook. On the whole, those effects had been quite limited thus far. Anecdotal reports indicated that a number of domestic producers, notably of agricul- tural, lumber, and wood products, had experienced some cancellations or postponements of orders from Asian customers and there was some evidence of increased imports from those nations. Exports to affected Asian nations were likely to be held back by declining incomes and rising prices of U.S. products in local currencies, and reportedly also by difficulties that importing firms in Asia were encountering in securing financing. The eventual effects of the Asian financial turmoil on the U.S. trade balance and the overall economy were unknown--in part because in some key countries needed reforms had yet to be implemented and markets to stabilize--but they clearly seemed likely to become more pronounced in coming months. Net exports also would be held down by the appreciation of the dollar against the currencies of the industrial countries that had occurred earlier in 1997 before the Asian crisis intensified. "]
