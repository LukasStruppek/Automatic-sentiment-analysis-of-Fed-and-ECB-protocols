[" Labor demand expanded rapidly in the fourth quarter; a sharp increase in nonfarm payroll employment in December followed large advances in October and November, and the average workweek edged up on balance over the three-month period. Job gains were widely spread across industries. In the fourth quarter, new hires in manufacturing accounted for more than half of that sector's total for the year, and construction employment also registered an unusually large rise compared with earlier in 1997. Job growth surged in retail trade and persisted at a rapid pace in service-producing industries. The civilian unemployment rate, at 4.7 percent in December, was near its low for the current economic expansion. "]
