[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed substantially on average in October and November from its level in the third quarter. The value of exports rose appreciably in the October-November period, with the largest increases occurring in automotive and agricultural products. The average value of imports for October and November changed little from the third-quarter rate. Imports of consumer goods and machinery rose, but they were about offset by declines in automotive products, computers, and, to a lesser extent, a wide variety of other products. The available information indicated that economic expansion remained healthy in most of the foreign G-7 countries, although slowing somewhat from the third quarter. In Asia, weakness in economic activity in Japan continued into the fourth quarter, and persisting financial turmoil was having strong adverse effects on the economies of a number of developing countries.
