Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the federal funds rate at the Committee's desired level. In the event, however, the rate averaged a little below its intended level, largely reflecting the efforts of the Trading Desk to keep reserve pressures around year-end to a minimum. Other short-term market rates declined somewhat on balance, partly owing to the disappearance of year-end pressures. Most long-term interest rates changed little over the intermeeting period, but Treasury bond yields moved up slightly on balance, apparently in response to incoming data suggesting stronger-than-expected economic growth.
