In a notation vote completed on March 22, 1999, the Committee unanimously approved an off-market sale of approximately $4.8 billion equivalent of the System's euro reserves to the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). In return, the System received $3.4 billion in dollars and $1.4 billion equivalent of Japanese yen from the ESF. The transaction reduced the System's overall holdings of foreign currencies to the level of those held by the ESF and left the resulting balances of euro and yen equal in both the System and ESF accounts.
