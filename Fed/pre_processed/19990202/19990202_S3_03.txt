In their review of developments across the nation, members reported a mix of high overall levels of economic activity in every region but softness in a number of specific business activities, notably those affected by foreign competition. In particular, many manufacturing firms along with businesses engaged in agriculture, mining, and energy were being adversely affected by weak demand in foreign markets, strong import competition, and depressed oil and other commodity prices in world markets. Foreign developments were seen as a continuing element of weakness for the U.S. economy and also as a major source of uncertainty in the outlook for the year ahead. In this regard many members referred in particular to the problems facing Brazil and the risk that further financial and economic instability in that nation would spread to other Latin American countries, with repercussions on the U.S. economy. Markets in the major trading nations around the world were likely to remain on the soft side, with Japan struggling to recover from its ongoing recession and economic growth in Europe showing signs of becoming more sluggish.
