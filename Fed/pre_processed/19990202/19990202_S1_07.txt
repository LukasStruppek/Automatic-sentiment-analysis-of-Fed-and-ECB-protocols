Consumer spending, supported by further sizable gains in income and net worth, remained robust through year-end. Retail sales rose sharply in the fourth quarter. Expenditures for durable goods, particularly motor vehicles, were very strong. Outlays for nondurable goods were brisk despite sluggish growth in spending for apparel. Unseasonably mild weather held down spending for energy services in November and December, but purchases of other types of services recorded moderate increases. Surveys in early 1999 indicated buoyant consumer sentiment, reflecting optimism about personal finances and the employment outlook.
