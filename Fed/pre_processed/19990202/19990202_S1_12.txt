Inflation remained low in 1998. Consumer prices changed little in December, reflecting a sizable drop in energy prices that offset the large increase in tobacco prices put in place after a settlement was reached between states and the tobacco makers. For 1998 as a whole, CPI inflation was slightly lower than in 1997; a substantial decline in energy prices more than offset a sizable pickup in food inflation and a small increase in core inflation. At the producer level, prices of finished goods edged down in 1998 following an appreciable decline in 1997. While finished energy prices fell by more in 1998, finished food prices were down only slightly and prices of core finished goods turned up after having been unchanged in 1997. Growth of hourly compensation of private industry workers slowed considerably in the fourth quarter of 1998, and the increase in hourly compensation for the year was little changed from that of 1997.
