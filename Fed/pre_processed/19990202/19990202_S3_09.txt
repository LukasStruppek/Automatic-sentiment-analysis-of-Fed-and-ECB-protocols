In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates in 1999 that it had established on a tentative basis in early July 1998. Those ranges included expansion of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999. The associated range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial sector debt was provisionally set at 3 to 7 percent for 1999. The tentative ranges for 1999 were unchanged from the ranges that had been adopted for the past several years.
