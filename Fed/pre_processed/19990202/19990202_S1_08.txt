Residential housing activity continued to display substantial strength in the fourth quarter. Single-family housing starts remained at a very high level in December, and sales of new homes in that month were only slightly below the record established in November. Sales of existing homes hit a record high in December. Unseasonably favorable weather extended the construction season in some areas of the country, but low mortgage rates, rapid employment growth, rising net worth, and special financing programs designed to broaden opportunities for homeownership were important factors in the strength of home sales. Multifamily housing starts edged lower in the fourth quarter as a December increase partially reversed a November decline; rents have continued to rise in real terms over the last several years, but vacancy rates have changed little.
