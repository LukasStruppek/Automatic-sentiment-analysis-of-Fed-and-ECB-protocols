The average deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services for October and November was a little smaller than the rate for the third quarter. The value of exports for the two-month period rose considerably, with the largest gains occurring in automotive products shipped to Canada, aircraft, machinery, agricultural products, and services. The value of imports also moved up, but by less than the value of exports. While the increases in imports were widespread across trade categories, particularly large advances were recorded for automotive products from Canada and Mexico and for computers. The available data suggested a weaker economic performance in most of the major foreign industrial countries in the fourth quarter; economic activity likely fell further in Japan, and economic growth apparently slowed in most countries of the euro bloc. Activity in most Asian developing countries remained depressed, though some seemed to be approaching a trough and Korea appeared to be in the early stages of a recovery. Moreover, economic conditions worsened in most Latin American economies.
