In keeping with the practice at meetings just prior to the Federal Reserve's semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress and the Chairman's associated testimony, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had provided individual projections of the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the year 1999. Their forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP in 1999 had a central tendency of 2-1/2 to 3 percent and a full range of 2 to 3-1/2 percent. Such growth was expected to be associated with a civilian unemployment rate in a range centering on 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of this year, implying little or no change from the current level. With regard to nominal GDP growth in 1999, the forecasts were mainly in a range of 4 to 4-1/2 percent, with an overall range of 3-3/4 to 5 percent. Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, had a central tendency of 2 to 2-1/2 percent, somewhat above the outcome for 1998 when the rise in the index was held down by a marked decline in energy prices and reduced prices of non-oil imports.
