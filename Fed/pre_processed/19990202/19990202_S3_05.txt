Growth in business capital spending also was expected to moderate as the year progressed to a pace well below that experienced in recent years. Members commented in this regard that slowing growth in overall spending normally fostered reduced capital investment, and indeed developments in the second half of 1998 suggested that such investment might already be on a less strong uptrend. Moreover, the prospects of reduced growth in profits and a less ebullient stock market could also be expected to damp business fixed investment. Nonetheless, growth in such investment likely would continue to exceed that of overall spending, reflecting ongoing efforts to improve efficiency and hold down labor costs in highly competitive markets and more generally to take advantage of the declining costs of business equipment and the rapid pace of technological innovation. Members also cited reports from contacts in various sectors of the economy and areas of the country that business plans continued to call for substantial outlays for business equipment. Nonresidential building activity remained robust in several regions, but given already ample capacity in many sectors, the prospects for such construction were relatively weak.
