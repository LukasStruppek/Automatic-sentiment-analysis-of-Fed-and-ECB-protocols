Looking ahead, an abatement or reversal of some of the temporary factors reducing prices was likely to raise measured inflation. The course of underlying inflation pressures was more difficult to gauge, however. If growth slowed to trend, as many expected, uncertainty about evolving relationships among economic activity, productivity growth, and wages made it unclear whether the enhanced competitiveness in many markets and greater cost reducing efforts of businesses would be sufficient to continue to hold price increases in check at the current degree of tautness in labor markets. Members generally agreed that if labor markets continued to tighten, cost and price pressures would begin to pick up. Some members also expressed concern that rapid money growth, should it persist, would suggest that monetary policy was too accommodative to contain inflation pressures. On balance, while a somewhat less favorable inflation performance was viewed as likely over the year ahead, the members did not anticipate any substantial deterioration in the inflation climate if growth in economic activity approximated the central tendency of their forecasts.
