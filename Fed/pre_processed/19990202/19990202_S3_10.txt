All the members endorsed a proposal to adopt the growth ranges for M2 and M3 in 1999 that had been established on a provisional basis in July of last year. According to a staff analysis, growth of these aggregates would moderate considerably this year but was likely to remain above the tentative ranges, especially in the case of M3. The rapid growth of M2 and M3 in 1998 was associated with outsized declines in their velocities that appeared to have resulted in part from the turbulent behavior of financial markets and related efforts by the public to move funds to relatively safe and liquid assets and to turn to banks for credit. Other factors appear to have included some rechanneling of financial flows into money-type balances after an extended period of surging stock market prices and the drop in the opportunity cost of holding money as market interest rates fell over the latter part of the year. The expansion of M3 was further stimulated by the ongoing strength in institution-only money market funds whose popularity as a cash management tool continued to grow.
