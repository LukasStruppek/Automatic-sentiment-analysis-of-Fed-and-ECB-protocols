The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services climbed to a new high in January, with the value of exports retreating from the peak reached in December and the value of imports rising sharply. The drop in exports was concentrated in computers, semiconductors, aircraft, chemicals, and consumer goods, while the increase in imports was primarily in oil and automotive products. The available information suggested that economic expansion continued to be robust in most foreign industrial economies. The Japanese economy was still the notable exception, though some favorable signs were evident. Economic activity in the developing countries also picked up further, with Asian countries registering the largest gains.
