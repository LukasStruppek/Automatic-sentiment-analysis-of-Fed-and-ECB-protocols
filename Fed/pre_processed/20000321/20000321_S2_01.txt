The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economic expansion would moderate gradually from its currently elevated pace to a rate around, or perhaps a little below, the growth of the economy's estimated potential. The expansion of domestic final demand increasingly would be held back by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects associated with large earlier gains in equity prices and by higher interest rates. As a result, the growth of spending on consumer durables and houses was expected to slow; in addition, business investment in equipment and software was projected to decelerate following a first-quarter surge that partly reflected information technology expenditures that had been postponed until after the century rollover. In addition, solid economic expansion abroad was expected to boost the growth of U.S. exports for some period ahead. Core price inflation was projected to increase somewhat over the forecast horizon, partly as a result of rising import prices and some firming of gains in nominal labor compensation in persistently tight labor markets that would not be fully offset by productivity growth.
