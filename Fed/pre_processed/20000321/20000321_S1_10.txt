The Committee also accepted a proposal by the Manager to make permanent the authority to use reverse repurchase agreements in the conduct of open market operations. Such agreements are equivalent to matched sale-purchase transactions, which the Manager has long been authorized to use, but reverse RPs have the advantage of much greater flexibility because they are the common practice in financial markets. The Manager indicated that he did not expect to use reverse RPs on a regular basis until the System's new trading system became operational, but in conjunction with existing tri-party arrangements there might be occasions in the interim when the timing of open market operations would make it desirable to use them instead of matched sale-purchase transactions. The members voted unanimously to adopt on a permanent basis, subject to the annual review required for all the Committee's instruments, paragraph 1 (c) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations in the form reproduced below.
