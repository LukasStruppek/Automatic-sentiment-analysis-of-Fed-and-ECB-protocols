Short-term interest rates have declined appre ciably since the Committee meeting on December 17, while longer-term rates have registered mixed changes. The Board of Governors approved a reduction in the discount rate from 4-1/2 to 3-1/2 percent on December 20. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose slightly on balance over the inter meeting period. After accelerating somewhat in the fourth quarter, M2 and M3 slowed in January, partly reflecting tempo rary distortions around year-end. For the year 1991, the expansion of both M2 and M3 is estimated to have been at rates a little above the lower ends of the Committee's ranges. Growth of total domestic nonfinan cial debt appears to have been marginally above the lower end of the Committee's monitoring range for the year.
