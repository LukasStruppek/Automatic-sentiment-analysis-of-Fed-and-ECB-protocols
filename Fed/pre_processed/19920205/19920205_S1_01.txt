The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity has remained sluggish. Total nonfarm payroll employment was little changed in December, and the civilian unemployment rate rose to 7.1 percent. Industrial production fell slightly in November and December, partly reflecting a sizable drop in motor vehicle assemblies. Consumer spending has been weak on balance in recent months amid continuing indications of depressed consumer confidence and essentially no growth in disposable income. Demand for business equipment has been uneven, while nonresiden tial construction has remained in a steep decline. Single-family housing starts continued to recover in December. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed in November, and for October-November combined the trade balance improved substantially from the third-quarter rate. Wage and price increases have continued to trend downward.
