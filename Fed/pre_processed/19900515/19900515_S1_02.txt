Short-term interest rates have declined a little on balance since the Committee meeting on March 27, while rates in long-term debt markets have risen slightly over the period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined con siderably over the intermeeting period. Growth of M2 slowed in April and that of M3 remained relatively weak. Through April, expansion of M2 and M3 was a little above the midpoint and around the lower end, respectively, of the ranges established by the Committee for 1990.
