The information received at this meeting suggested that the economy expanded at a moderate pace over the third quarter. Low interest rates helped to maintain a buoyant housing market and spending by both consumers and businesses was firm. Available information suggested that the recent tempo of economic activity continued into the current quarter despite the restraint imparted on real incomes and consumer confidence from higher oil prices. However, industrial production was flat in recent months, and hiring activity was lackluster through September before advancing sharply in October. Inflation measures continued at low levels through September.
