In the Committees discussion of current and prospective developments, the members generally expressed assessments that economic expansion in the neighborhood of the rate of growth of the economys potential appeared to have become even more firmly established over recent months, despite the drag from higher energy prices. Recent data and anecdotal information suggested that spending by businesses and households had been reasonably robust of late, supported by accommodative financial conditions, continuing gains in productivity, and increasing employment. Looking forward, economic fundamentals appeared to be favorable for continued solid growth, and while fiscal stimulus would abate next year, a flattening out of energy prices, as markets seemed to anticipate, would bolster economic expansion. However, significant uncertainties surrounded the prospects for energy prices and fiscal policy, as well as the external sector. The Committee anticipated that underlying inflation pressures would remain contained as monetary accommodation was withdrawn. Core consumer price inflation had been quite damped on average in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored, despite further increases in energy prices and prospective increases in near-term headline inflation.
