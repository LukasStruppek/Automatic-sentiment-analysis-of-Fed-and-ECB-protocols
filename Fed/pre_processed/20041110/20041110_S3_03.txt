While acknowledging data indicating a rebound in consumption spending in recent months, Committee members reported contacts with retail merchants that suggested mixed readings on the ongoing pace of consumer buying. The effect of higher energy prices on real incomes was likely still restraining consumer spending. Moreover, the stock of automobiles owned by households had risen substantially in recent years, and the willingness of households to purchase autos was seen as continuing to depend importantly on the provision of incentives by manufacturers. Home buying and residential construction generally remained robust, although a few members pointed to some moderation in activity in selected markets. It was noted that a slowdown in the rate of increase in home prices going forward might lead households to increase their desired saving. However, the risk of any significant drop-off in the growth of consumer spending would likely diminish with a sustained rebound in the pace of hiring.
