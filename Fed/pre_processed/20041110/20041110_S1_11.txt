Consumer prices continued to advance at a moderate rate in recent months, although both overall and core consumer price measures rose a bit faster in the twelve months ending in September 2004 than in the year-earlier period. Expectations of near-term inflation picked up in October, consistent with the increase in energy prices. Labor costs continued to rise moderately. The increase in the employment cost index for private compensation over the third quarter was a bit below the average pace of the last two years.
