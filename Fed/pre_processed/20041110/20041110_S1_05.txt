Employment gains were subdued in the third quarter, but showed substantial strength in October. Job growth last month was fairly widespread, although heavy hiring in the construction sector was due partly to efforts to repair damage from the four hurricanes that hit the southeastern states. Employment increases were particularly large in the financial and services sectors. However, a small decline was registered in employment in the manufacturing sector. The average workweek held steady in October at its third-quarter level and was a bit above the average for the second quarter. Despite the strong increase in payroll employment, the household survey indicated a slight increase in the unemployment rate to 5.5 percent in October.
