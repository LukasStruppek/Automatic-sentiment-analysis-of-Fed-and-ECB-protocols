Business investment spending on equipment and software continued to expand at a rapid pace in the third quarter, supported by positive fundamentals that included robust business output, low interest rates and readily available credit, and healthy business balance sheets. Outlays for high-tech equipment and software stepped down in the third quarter, but spending on other types of equipment, including transportation, was at a high level. At the same time, investment in nonresidential structures, which had turned up in the second quarter, softened in the third quarter. Construction spending for retail buildings and warehouses advanced, but high vacancy rates for office buildings held back investment in that sector.
