Committee members remarked on signs of improvement in labor market conditions. While acknowledging the need to be cautious about readings from a single labor market report, members saw the increase in payroll employment in October and the upward revisions to previous months as encouraging. Furthermore, business contacts in several regions were indicating greater difficulty in filling some types of positions, both skilled and unskilled. Nevertheless, many firms evidently remained slow to expand hiring, in part because of rising benefit costs. One member commented on the performance of a few key industries, citing evidence that the job losses since the business cycle peak had been driven primarily by weak demand rather than productivity improvements. Although the extent of economic slack was uncertain, some members indicated a sense that the economy needed to grow faster than trend in order to take up remaining unused resources.
