In the course of the Committee's review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members underscored the retarding effects of reduced confidence and heightened caution on household and business spending but noted that it was difficult to attribute the relative contributions of geopolitical risk and worries about the economy to the emergence of weaker spending. In any event, consumer expenditures appeared to have been held back recently by the impact of higher energy costs, weak labor markets, and severe winter weather in the eastern part of the United States. Sales of motor vehicles had declined substantially since the start of the year despite the introduction of enhanced sales incentives. Non-automotive retail sales, after a pickup at the end of 2002 that had extended through the first several weeks of this year, had weakened more recently. Whether the recent experience augured further softening in consumer spending was uncertain, but some members commented that this weak performance was not reassuring with regard to forecasts of substantial strengthening of the expansion later this year. Many observed, however, that a favorable outcome to the hostilities in the Middle East and lower oil prices in line with quotations in futures markets should generate a positive response in equity markets, boost consumer sentiment, and foster a rebound in consumer spending as the year progressed.
