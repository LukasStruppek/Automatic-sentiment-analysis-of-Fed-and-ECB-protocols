[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, the members supported a proposal calling for some slight easing in reserve conditions. Although a pickup to an acceptable rate of expansion was seen as the most likely course for the economy in coming quarters, the risks of a shortfall in growth were believed to be significant. At the same time, while most members were forecasting high levels of resource use and little change in the rate of inflation this year, they saw only a very limited risk that a slight easing move might foster higher inflation under prevailing circumstances, and some felt that there were favorable prospects for a slightly improved inflation performance. Under the circumstances, a slight decrease was warranted in the real federal funds rate from a level that a number of members considered still a bit to the firm side--a stance that seemed less appropriate in light of the reduced threat over the last year of a pickup in inflation. One member pointed out that such a decrease would tend to counter the effects on aggregate demand of the recent rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, which might continue to move higher if interest rate declines expected by the markets were not forthcoming. It was noted that postponing a decision in this uncertain economic climate could be defended on the ground that more evidence was needed to ascertain whether the weakness in the economy was quite temporary or more lasting; if it was the former, inflationary pressures could re-emerge at lower interest rates. On the other hand, a few members commented that the currently sluggish performance of the economy could be read as calling for a more pronounced easing move, but they preferred a cautious approach to policy in light of current inflation trends and the uncertainties that surrounded their forecasts of some strengthening in the economy.
