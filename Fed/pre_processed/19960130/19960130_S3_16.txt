[" Mr. Lindsey and Ms. Yellen dissented because they preferred somewhat higher ranges for M2 and M3. They recognized that the relationships between the ranges for the monetary aggregates and broad measures of economic performance were subject to substantial uncertainty, but ranges higher than those adopted on a tentative basis in July 1995 were more likely to encompass monetary expansion consistent with the central tendency of members' current forecasts of nominal GDP growth for 1996. Raising the ranges for M2 and M3 would in their view conform those ranges more closely with the provisions in the Federal Reserve Act that require the System to communicate to the Congress its objectives and plans for the growth of the aggregates for the calendar year. They believed the Committee could readily explain that such an adjustment to the ranges did not represent a lessened commitment to its price stability goal or an increased emphasis on the monetary aggregates in policy formulation.
