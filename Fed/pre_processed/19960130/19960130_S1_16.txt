[" Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December and January. The pickup in M2 growth partly reflected the effect of recent declines in short-term interest rates; those declines had made money market instruments less attractive relative to household savings accounts in M2, whose offering rates tend to be adjusted downward with a considerable lag. In addition, the flattening of the term structure of interest rates had lessened the comparative attractiveness of bond mutual funds, which had continued to experience only light inflows. Faster growth of M3 in December and January was associated with both the pickup in M2 expansion and the issuance of additional large time deposits to help finance a noticeable step-up in bank loan demand in January. The expansion of M2 from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995 was in the upper half of the Committee's annual range, and M3 grew at the upper end of its range. Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had been moderate in recent months, and for the year was near the midpoint of this aggregate's monitoring range. "]
