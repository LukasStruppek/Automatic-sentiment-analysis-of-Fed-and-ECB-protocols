[' Retail sales continued to grow at a relatively modest rate in December, and the fourth-quarter increase was considerably smaller than those of the previous two quarters. In the fourth quarter, lower spending at general merchandisers offset much of the sales gains registered at automotive dealerships, furniture and appliance stores, and building and supply outlets. Consumer surveys indicated some deterioration in consumer confidence in January. Recent indicators of housing demand and activity were mixed. Sales of new homes edged still lower in November (latest data available), and sales of existing homes declined by a larger amount in December than in November. However, housing starts rebounded in November from a sizable October decline, and conditions in mortgage markets remained quite favorable, led by a further decline in rates. ']
