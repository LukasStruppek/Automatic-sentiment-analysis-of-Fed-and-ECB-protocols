[' The Committee also discussed alternatives to the monetary aggregates for communicating its intentions with regard to the course of inflation over the longer run. Some members thought that explicit numerical goals or forecasts for inflation over a period of years would have several important benefits, including enhanced credibility that could reduce the costs of achieving price stability and greater flexibility to respond to the emergence of economic weakness by easing policy for a limited period of time without arousing inflation concerns. Other members, while endorsing fully the long-term goal of price stability, had a number of reservations about implementing such proposals, especially at this time. Based on experience in the United States and elsewhere, many were skeptical about the payoff in terms of greater credibility or flexibility in policy implementation. Moreover, they believed that substantially more study and deliberation were required to explore fully the alternatives and the consequences of changes in the way the Committee formulated and communicated its objectives. They also thought that any such assessment would need to take account of the prospects for, or disposition of, closely related legislation that was now being considered in the Congress. The Committee did not take any action on this issue at this meeting, but it recognized that the matter would need to be revisited from time to time. ']
