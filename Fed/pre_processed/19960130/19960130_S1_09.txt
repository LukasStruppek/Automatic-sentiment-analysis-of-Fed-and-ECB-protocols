[" The information available on business inventories suggested that inventory imbalances might have emerged in a few sectors in association with weaker-than-expected sales. Motor vehicle inventories were at elevated levels compared with sales in late 1995, and manufacturers responded by offering incentive packages on new cars and trucks and by adjusting downward their January production schedules. Data on manufacturing and retail trade inventories for November had been delayed, but published information on inventories held by wholesale distributors indicated a decline in that month, reversing part of October's sizable run-up. Much of the decline occurred in nondurable goods, although machinery distributors also reported a sizable liquidation. The inventory-sales ratio for the wholesale trade sector edged down in November but remained near the high end of its range in recent years. "]
