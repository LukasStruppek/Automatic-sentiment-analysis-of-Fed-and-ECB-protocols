[' In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had prepared individual projections of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and inflation for the year 1996. Measured on the basis of chain-weighted indexes, the forecasts of the growth in real GDP had a central tendency of 2 to 2-1/4 percent and a full range of 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 percent for the period from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The members and nonmember presidents generally anticipated that economic expansion in line with their forecasts would be associated with employment growth close to that of the labor force. Accordingly, their forecasts of the civilian rate of unemployment in the fourth quarter of 1996 were near the current level, with a central tendency of 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 percent and a full range of 5-1/2 to 6 percent. Projections of the rate of inflation, as reflected in the consumer price index, had a central tendency of 2-3/4 to 3 percent; that central tendency was on the high side of the outcome for 1995-- when the rise in the index was held down by damped increases in food prices and declines in energy prices--but a few of the forecasts anticipated a slightly lower rate of inflation.
