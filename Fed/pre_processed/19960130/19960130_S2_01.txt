[' The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity would expand at a relatively slow pace over the near term. This forecast was not materially different from that prepared for the December meeting, except for a slightly weaker outlook for the current quarter that was related in part to an inventory correction and the effects of unusually severe winter weather on spending and output. Over the remainder of the two-year forecast horizon, the economy was expected to grow generally along its estimated potential. Consumer spending was anticipated to keep pace with the growth of disposable income; concerns about job security remained and consumer debt burdens had risen further, but the still-ample availability of credit and the substantial rise in the value of household equity holdings would support further increases in consumption. The further decline in mortgage rates recently from already-favorable levels would help to sustain homebuilding activity at a relatively high level. With sales and profits projected to grow more slowly, and with utilization of existing capacity having eased considerably, business investment in new equipment and structures was expected to expand at a more moderate rate. In light of the recent strengthening of the dollar, the external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on real activity over the projection period as a whole. Much uncertainty still surrounded the fiscal outlook, but the recent impasse in the budget negotiations between the Administration and the Congress suggested a lower degree of fiscal restraint over coming years than had been assumed in the previous forecast. Given the projected outlook, rates of utilization of labor and capital resources and of inflation were not expected to change materially. ']
