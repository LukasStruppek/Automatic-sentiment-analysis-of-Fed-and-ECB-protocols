[' Business fixed investment, which was contributing substantially to the current strength of the expansion, was likely to remain a positive factor in sustaining the overall growth of the economy during the year ahead. Even so, as the expansion matured and growth in final demand tended to moderate, business investment could be expected to soften. As in the case of consumer spending, however, there were few signs of any slowing in the current data or anecdotal reports. Indeed, members saw growing indications of some improvement in nonresidential construction activity as brisk economic expansion tended to absorb increasing amounts of previously vacant commercial and industrial space and prices of such facilities tended to firm. In the homebuilding sector, the latest available data did not indicate any weakening in housing construction despite the rise in mortgage interest rates. However, anecdotal reports from different parts of the country suggested that the single-family sector might be weakening. At the same time, construction of multifamily units continued to exhibit strength in a number of areas, and this sector appeared to be on a gradual uptrend as falling vacancy rates brought increases in rents. On balance, some modest softening in overall housing construction was seen as likely in response to the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates. ']
