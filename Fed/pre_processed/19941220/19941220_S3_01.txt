[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to continuing indications of robust expansion in employment, output, and spending and to very high and rising levels of resource utilization. They saw scant evidence at this point of any moderation in the growth of overall economic activity, including little apparent response thus far in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy to earlier policy tightening actions. Several observed that much of the expansionary momentum in the economy was likely to carry into at least the early part of next year, with potential inflationary consequences, but a number also commented that appreciable slowing during the year to a more sustainable and less inflationary pace remained a reasonable expectation. It was likely that much of the restraint from the policy firming actions implemented this year had not yet been experienced; those actions had reversed an accommodative policy that had been in place through early 1994, the effects of which probably were still being felt in the latter part of 1994. The members acknowledged that the timing and extent of the slowing in the expansion were subject to considerable uncertainty. However, with the economy now operating at or even slightly above its noninflationary potential, price and wage pressures were likely to build unless the anticipated slowing occurred relatively soon. Key measures of inflation including consumer prices, wages, and producer prices of finished goods did not display any evident uptrend at this juncture, but this could reflect a delay in the adjustment of inflation to capacity constraints and possibly some greater productivity and flexibility in the economy than had been assumed.
