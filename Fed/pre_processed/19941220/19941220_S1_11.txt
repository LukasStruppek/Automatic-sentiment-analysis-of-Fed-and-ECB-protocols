[' Despite further sizable increases in the prices of many goods at the early stages of processing, inflation at the consumer level remained moderate in October and November. Energy prices were unchanged on balance over the two months, while food prices edged higher. Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices advanced at a slightly slower rate over October and November than in earlier months of the year and also increased a little less over the twelve months ended in November than over the comparable year-earlier period. At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy were down over the October-November period, but they rose by a little larger amount for the twelve months ended in November than they had in the year-earlier period. The increase in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers over the October-November period remained in the moderate range that had prevailed for some time, although a pickup in earnings growth was evident in a few sectors, notably construction and services. Over the past twelve months, hourly earnings increased at a slightly faster pace than they had over the year-earlier period. ']
