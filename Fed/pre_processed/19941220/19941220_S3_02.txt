[" In the course of the Committee's discussion, members reported on regional business conditions, which continued to exhibit local variations ranging from modest expansion in some areas to robust growth in others. Reflecting widespread strength in new orders, manufacturing firms outside the defense industry typically were operating at high levels of capacity utilization, and there were numerous anecdotal reports of tightening labor markets. As they had at earlier meetings, members remarked that despite the increases that had occurred in interest rates, financial conditions remained generally supportive of vigorous economic activity. Some noted that the financial markets were displaying a great deal of resilience and in particular that they had on balance weathered fairly readily the recent financial problems of a number of local governments and private corporations that had experienced large unanticipated losses on their investments. Banking institutions remained aggressive in their efforts to extend loans to businesses and consumers. "]
