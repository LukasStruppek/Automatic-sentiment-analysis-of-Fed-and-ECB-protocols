[" Growth of M2 resumed in November after several months of decline. M2's expansion largely reflected sizable inflows to small time deposits and retail money market funds that in part might have been associated with accelerated outflows from bond mutual funds and reduced inflows to stock mutual funds. M3 growth slowed a little in November as some investors shifted funds from institution-only money market accounts, whose opportunity costs had widened after the November policy tightening, into direct holdings of securities. For the year through November, M2 grew at a rate at the bottom of the Committee's range for 1994 and M3 at a rate in the lower half of its range for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months, and through October (latest data) this debt measure had grown at a rate in the lower half of its monitoring range.
