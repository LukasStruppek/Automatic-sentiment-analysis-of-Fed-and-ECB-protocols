[" At its meeting on November 15, 1994, the Committee adopted a directive that called for a significant increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible rise of 3/4 percentage point in the discount rate. The Committee did not include in the directive a presumption about likely further adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months. "]
