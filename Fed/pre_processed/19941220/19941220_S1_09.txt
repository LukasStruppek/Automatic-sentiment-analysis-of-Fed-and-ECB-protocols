[' Business inventory investment was relatively robust in October. Manufacturing inventories rebounded after a small decline in September; a sizable amount of the October increase occurred at firms producing computers, office machinery, and telecommunications equipment for which demand had been strong. For manufacturing as a whole, the stocks-to-shipments ratio remained near a historically low level. Wholesale inventories continued to climb at a pace in line with sales, and the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector stayed near the middle of its range over recent years. Retail inventory accumulation slowed substantially in October; much of the slowdown reflected a sharp drop in stocks at automotive dealerships. With sales up sharply, the inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector fell in October and remained near the middle of its range over recent years. ']
