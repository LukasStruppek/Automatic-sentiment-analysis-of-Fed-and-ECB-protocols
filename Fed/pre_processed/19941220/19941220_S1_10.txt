[" The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened somewhat in October from its September level and from its average rate for the third quarter. The increase in the deficit from September's level reflected a small decline in the value of exports of goods and services, which resulted primarily from reduced aircraft shipments, and a small rise in the value of imports. Economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to expand rapidly in the third quarter, and available indicators generally suggested further substantial gains in the fourth quarter.
