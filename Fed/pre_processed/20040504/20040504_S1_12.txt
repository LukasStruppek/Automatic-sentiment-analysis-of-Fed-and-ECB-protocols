In the United States, the core consumer price index advanced at a faster rate in the first quarter than it had in the fourth quarter, reflecting the pass-through of higher energy prices and a leveling off of goods prices after sizable declines last year. The higher goods price inflation owed, in part, to the recent run-up in the prices of non-oil imports, energy, and other commodities. The price index for core personal consumption expenditures also rose at a faster rate in the first quarter than it had late last year. Despite the rise in inflation this year, however, the cumulative increase in the overall consumer price index for the year ending in March was somewhat less than the advance for the twelve months ending in March 2003. In the year ending in March, the increase in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures was similar to that of a year earlier. Survey measures of near-term inflation expectations edged up somewhat in March and April, but measures of longer-term expectations decreased. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose notably less for the twelve months ending in March than they had in the year-earlier period. The overall increase in the employment cost index for private industry for the twelve months ending in March was about the same as that for the twelve-month period ending a year earlier, as wages and salaries decelerated and benefits accelerated.
