The U.S. international trade deficit shrank in February from January's record high, with exports increasing across a range of major categories of goods. Economic growth in the major industrialized countries in the first quarter was uneven. The economies of Japan and the United Kingdom likely continued to expand, though at paces below those of late last year. In the euro area, economic indicators were mixed. A moderation of growth in Canada led the Bank of Canada to ease monetary policy for the third time this year, citing a need to support aggregate demand. Inflation was little changed in Canada and the euro area, but it slipped further in the United Kingdom. In Japan, consumer prices were about unchanged, while wholesale prices edged up in March relative to their level of a year earlier and posted the first increase on a twelve-month basis since July 2000.
