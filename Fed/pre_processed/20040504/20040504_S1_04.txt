The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy expanded at a rapid pace in the first quarter. Consumer spending and the housing market continued to exhibit strength. Business fixed investment grew smartly, reflecting increased outlays for equipment and software that more than offset a significant fall in investment in nonresidential structures. The labor market displayed further signs of improvement during the quarter, capped by a significant increase in private payrolls in March. Recent increases in the prices of imports and commodities showed through to a pickup in core consumer price inflation during the first quarter, although some of the categories that registered large gains had posted unusually small increases earlier.
