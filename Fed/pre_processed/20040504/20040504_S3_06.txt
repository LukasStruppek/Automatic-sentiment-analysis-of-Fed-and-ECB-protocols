The external sector was expected to provide limited support for U.S. economic growth over the next two years. Expansion of foreign economies was likely to fuel increases in U.S. exports, with strength expected particularly in computers and semiconductors. Real imports, however, also appeared likely to continue rising strongly as domestic demand climbed further, leading to a widening of already substantial trade and current account deficits. Some members saw a risk that growth in certain rapidly expanding regions abroad could slow, perhaps sharply, with potentially significant effects on the demand for U.S. exports as well as on global commodity prices.
