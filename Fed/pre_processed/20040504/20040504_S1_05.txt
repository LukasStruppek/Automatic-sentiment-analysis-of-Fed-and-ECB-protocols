The labor market showed renewed vigor during the first quarter. The growth in payroll employment during March pushed the average monthly gain for the first quarter as a whole well above that of the fourth quarter of last year. Hiring during the quarter was widespread across industries, with large increases in construction, retail trade, and business and nonbusiness services. Net job losses in manufacturing, which had waned during the winter, reportedly came to an end by March. Some surveys of business hiring intentions also suggested renewed strength. However, a small decline in the average workweek during March held down the increase in aggregate hours, which rose at a slightly slower pace in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter. Moreover, the unemployment rate ticked up to 5.7 percent in March, and the labor force participation rate remained low.
