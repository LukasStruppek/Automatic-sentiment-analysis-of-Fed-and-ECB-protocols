Residential housing activity remained high in the first quarter despite a marked rise in mortgage interest rates. Smoothing through weather-related swings in the volatile monthly data, the underlying pace of single-family housing starts continued to display appreciable strength. Sales of new homes jumped to a record level in March, and sales of existing homes increased to their highest level since last September. In the multifamily sector, construction activity also remained robust through March, even though the vacancy rate for multifamily units reached a record high in the first quarter.
