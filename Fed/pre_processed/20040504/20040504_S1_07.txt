Real consumer spending grew at a somewhat faster pace in the first quarter than it had in the fourth quarter. Retail sales rose briskly, with strength widespread across spending categories, while expenditures on services also posted a substantial increase. Light vehicle sales were down slightly for the first quarter as a whole, but they firmed in March. Solid growth in wages and salaries and an increase in tax refunds generated a large increase in real disposable personal income in the first quarter. Measures of consumer confidence were roughly stable in March and April.
