After a protracted period of meager gains in employment, conditions in the U.S. labor market evidently were improving in recent weeks. In addition to noting the substantial jump in payrolls in March, several members relayed anecdotal information from business contacts around the nation that hiring was continuing to pick up and that firms were planning further increases in workforces. Some temporary help firms reported rising demand, a possible precursor of a pickup in permanent hiring. A number of members cited reports of difficulties in hiring within certain job families in which specialized skills were in short supply together with indications that wage increases in those occupations tended to be larger than average. Even so, considerable slack seemed to remain in the labor market overall, and wage gains on the whole were moderate.
