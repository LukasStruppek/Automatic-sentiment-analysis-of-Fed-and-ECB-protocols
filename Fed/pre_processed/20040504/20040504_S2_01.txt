The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would continue to expand briskly for the rest of 2004 before decelerating somewhat in 2005 as fiscal policy shifted to a slightly restrictive stance. The considerable monetary and fiscal stimulus this year and still-strong advances in structural productivity were expected to cause businesses to shed still more of the caution they had been exhibiting in investing and hiring. The labor market was projected to show steady improvement through the end of 2004, but the forecasted pace of hiring was expected to slow a little next year as economic growth moderated. The staff anticipated that inventories would increase at a modest rate during the forecast horizon as businesses responded to continued strength in demand. Business spending on equipment and software was expected to remain strong, with the expiration of the partial-expensing tax provision at the end of 2004 adding impetus this year. The rise in mortgage rates was not likely to show through to demand for housing until the second half of 2004 and was expected to be partially offset in the longer term by rising employment and personal income. The increases in employment and income were also projected to continue to boost consumer spending. In light of recent increases in some price measures, the staff anticipated a transitory rise in the pace of core inflation in the near term. However, it was expected that the remaining slack in resource utilization and strong productivity growth would keep core inflation at a low level over the forecast period.
