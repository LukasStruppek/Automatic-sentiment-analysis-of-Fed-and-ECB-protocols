Consumer expenditures were expected to be well maintained in conjunction with projections of appreciable further growth in jobs and incomes and a ready availability of financing. A major uncertainty in the outlook for the consumer sector was the largely unpredictable behavior of the stock market. The very large equity price increases in recent years evidently had contributed to high levels of consumer confidence and robust consumer spending, and the further gains in those prices thus far this year would continue to bolster spending for a while. A leveling trend in stock market prices, should one materialize, likely would have a significant restraining effect on consumer confidence and the growth of spending over time. In addition, the substantial accumulation of durable goods by consumers in recent years was seen as a constraining influence on spending for such goods going forward.
