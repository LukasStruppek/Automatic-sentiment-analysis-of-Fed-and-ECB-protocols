The members nonetheless agreed that their increased concerns about the outlook for inflation called for the adoption of an asymmetric directive that was tilted toward tightening and, in keeping with the Committee's recently reaffirmed policy, to announce that change after this meeting. The Committee had said that it would not necessarily publish every change in the symmetry of its directive, but this shift to asymmetry represented a significant change in the Committee's assessment of the risks of higher inflation, and its announcement would alert the financial markets and the public more generally to this development. That, in turn, should encourage stabilizing reactions in financial markets and perhaps reduce the odds of an outsized response if evolving circumstances in the near term were to require an adjustment to policy that had not previously been anticipated. It was important that the public, including those who participated in financial markets, understood the Committee's resolve to keep inflation at a low level. A number of members emphasized, however, that the adoption and announcement of an asymmetrical directive should not be viewed as necessarily implying a near-term policy change or indeed any change over time unless circumstances warranted. For now, an asymmetric directive represented the right balance in terms of positioning the Committee for possible tightening at some point.
