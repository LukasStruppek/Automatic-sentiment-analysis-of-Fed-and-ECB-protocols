Open market operations throughout the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the federal funds rate at around 4-3/4 percent. The average rate for the period was in line with the Committee's target level; however, substantial fluctuations in the rate associated with tax-season uncertainties complicated reserve management. Yields on Treasury securities rose appreciably on balance, with the largest increases occurring in intermediate- and longer-term maturities. The climb in rates reflected not only the strength of incoming data on the U.S. economy but also improved economic prospects in many foreign countries and higher world commodity prices. Increasing optimism about economic conditions in the United States and abroad apparently eased concerns about the creditworthiness of business borrowers, especially firms of relatively low credit standing, and rates on private obligations registered mixed changes over the period. Most key measures of share prices in equity markets recorded sizable gains over the intermeeting period.
