Industrial production increased substantially in March and April after a period of sluggish growth. In manufacturing, the production of durable goods rose rapidly in both months, paced by sharp increases in the output of semiconductors and motor vehicles and parts. The production of office automation equipment picked up from an already rapid pace in the March-April period, and the manufacture of communications equipment surged in April. Although growth in the output of nondurable goods had increased somewhat in recent months, the level of production was still below its year-earlier level. The step-up in industrial production in recent months had lifted the rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity, but it remained below its long-term average.
