The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened substantially in January and February from its fourth-quarter average, with exports falling sharply and imports rising strongly. The drop in exports in the January-February period nearly reversed the large fourth-quarter increase, with substantial declines occurring in aircraft, machinery, industrial supplies, and agricultural products. The jump in imports was concentrated in consumer goods, automotive products, computers, and semiconductors. Economic growth continued to be sluggish in many of the major foreign industrial countries, according to the limited information available for the first quarter. Growth was weak on balance in the euro zone and the United Kingdom, and there were few signs of economic recovery in Japan. However, the expansion in Canada appeared to have remained strong. Elsewhere, the Korean economy grew vigorously in the first quarter, and there were indications that the slowdown in economic activity in Southeast Asia and Latin America might have bottomed out, with some countries beginning to recover.
