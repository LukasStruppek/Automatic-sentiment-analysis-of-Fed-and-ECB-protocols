M2 and M3 recorded sizable increases in April, apparently arising from a buildup of liquid accounts by households to make larger-than-usual final tax payments. For the year through April, M2 and M3 had grown less rapidly than in 1998; even so, M2 was estimated to have grown this year at a rate somewhat above the Committee's annual range, and M3 at a rate slightly above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range.
