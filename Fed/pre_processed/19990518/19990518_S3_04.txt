Expenditures by business firms for durable equipment were expected to post further sizable gains this year and next, though probably at rates somewhat below those recorded in recent years. Technical advances and ongoing competitive pressures were likely to remain relatively stimulative factors, but a number of developments also were anticipated to exert a tempering influence. These included the large buildup in equipment over the course of recent years, some moderation in the growth of demand for capital associated with slower expansion of overall spending, and in these circumstances more sluggish growth of business profits. The behavior of stock market prices also would play a role in the cost of business finance and the level of business confidence, but one that could not readily be predicted. According to anecdotal reports, commercial and other nonresidential construction activity was at high levels in several regions, though constrained in a number of areas by shortages of skilled labor and some construction materials. Concerns about overbuilding were reported in a few parts of the country. Residential construction activity also was at a high level, and backlogs had developed in some regions because of shortages of labor and some building materials. While these backlogs and continued affordability of home purchases were expected to help sustain residential construction activity near current levels for some period of time, statistical and survey indicators pointed to some loss of momentum in housing sales and new construction, perhaps partly in response to the rise in long-term interest rates.
