The trade-weighted value of the dollar in foreign exchange markets depreciated somewhat over the intermeeting period in relation to the currencies of a broad group of important U.S. trading partners. The dollar's decline partly reflected improvements in the economic and financial outlook for many emerging market economies. The dollar also depreciated significantly against the Canadian and Australian currencies as the prices of metals, oil, and lumber moved higher. By contrast, the dollar moved up on balance in terms of the euro and the Japanese yen. A reduction in the European Central Bank's refinance rate and the diminished prospects for a near-term resolution of hostilities in the Balkans weighed on the euro. The dollar's rise against the yen evidently was partly a response to a decline in the yield on ten-year Japanese government bonds while dollar yields moved higher.
