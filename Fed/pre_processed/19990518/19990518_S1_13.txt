Consumer prices rose substantially in April. Energy prices increased sharply, food prices edged up, and the prices of consumer items other than food and energy rose appreciably. For the twelve months ended in April, core consumer inflation was slightly higher than for the year-earlier period. Producer prices of finished goods also increased in April, but by less than consumer prices. Finished energy prices were up sharply, but prices of finished foods declined appreciably, and prices of core producer goods advanced only slightly. For the twelve months ended in April, core producer inflation was up noticeably over that for the year-earlier period, reflecting importantly the sharp increase in prices of tobacco products. In contrast to price inflation, labor costs appeared to have remained quiescent. The increase in average hourly earnings was the same in April as in March, and the rise for the twelve months ended in April was significantly smaller than that for the year-earlier period.
