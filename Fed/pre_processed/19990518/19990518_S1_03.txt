The Committee voted unanimously to extend for one year beginning in mid-December 1999 the reciprocal currency ("swap") arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico. The arrangement with the Bank of Canada is in the amount of $2 billion equivalent and that with the Bank of Mexico in the amount of $3 billion equivalent. Both arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve's participation in the North American Framework Agreement, which was established in 1994. The vote to renew was taken at this meeting rather than later in the year to give the Committee members a timely opportunity to discuss whether or not they wanted to extend the maturity of the agreements; the terms of the agreements require that any decision not to renew be communicated to swap line partners at least 6 months in advance of the swap maturities.
