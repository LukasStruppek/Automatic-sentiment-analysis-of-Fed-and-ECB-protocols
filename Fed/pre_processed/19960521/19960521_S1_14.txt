[' Growth of M2 and M3 slowed substantially in April after having recorded sizable increases earlier in the year. Weakness in demand deposits after unusually rapid first-quarter expansion and sluggishness in currency demand were factors in the slowdown. In addition, the rise in market interest rates in recent months, which had increased the opportunity costs of holding retail deposits, likely had a restraining effect on these deposits. For the year through April, both aggregates grew at rates somewhat above the upper bounds of their respective ranges for the year. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt remained moderate on balance over recent months, and this aggregate stayed near the middle of its monitoring range for the year. ']
