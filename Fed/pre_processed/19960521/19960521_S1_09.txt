[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services in the first quarter was substantially larger than in the fourth quarter of last year. The value of imports increased sharply in the first quarter after declining in the two previous quarters. Moreover, growth in the value of exports slowed considerably in the first quarter from the pace of other recent quarters. Available data indicated that the performance of the economies of the major foreign industrial countries was mixed in the first quarter. The recovery in Japan was still under way while economic activity in continental Europe remained generally weak, with the German economy apparently having contracted further and the French economy exhibiting signs of only a modest upturn after a fourth-quarter decline. Moderate further expansion in economic activity evidently was occurring in Canada and the United Kingdom. ']
