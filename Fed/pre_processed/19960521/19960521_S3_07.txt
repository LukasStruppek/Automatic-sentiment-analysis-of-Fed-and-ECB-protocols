[' The outlook for inflation was of key importance to the formulation of monetary policy at this time, but it was clouded by substantial uncertainty. One source of uncertainty was the behavior of food and energy prices. Increases in these prices largely accounted for the more rapid rise in consumer prices thus far this year, and they likely would continue to add to inflation in the months ahead. Retail energy prices had risen appreciably, but at least some of that increase was expected to be reversed over the near term. Retail food prices did not yet display any significant effects from the sizable rise in grain prices in recent months, and while some effects on retail prices were likely, their extent and duration were difficult to gauge at this point. Moreover, it was difficult to anticipate how much the higher food and energy prices might affect inflation expectations and wage demands and thereby potentially become embedded more generally in the price structure.
