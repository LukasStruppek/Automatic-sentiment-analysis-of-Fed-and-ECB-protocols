[' Retail sales declined somewhat in April after posting a strong gain in the first quarter. Sales of durable goods, which had increased substantially in the first quarter, retraced part of that advance in April; the drop more than offset a further rise in sales of nondurable goods. Housing activity was well sustained in April, with the run-up in mortgage rates that began in February having had little perceptible effect to date. Single-family housing starts were up considerably in April, and sales of new and existing homes remained brisk in March (latest data available). Business fixed investment accelerated sharply in the first quarter of 1996 following three quarters of relatively moderate expansion; however, recent data on orders and contracts pointed, on balance, to some deceleration in business spending on both durable equipment and nonresidential structures. Much of the first-quarter pickup reflected stronger spending for durable equipment; purchases of computing equipment remained robust and spending on other durable equipment increased. Nonresidential construction activity also advanced further in the first quarter; however, construction of office buildings continued to lag, and construction of other commercial buildings slowed after recording strong gains for several years.
