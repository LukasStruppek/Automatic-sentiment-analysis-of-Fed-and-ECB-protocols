[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. The members agreed that the balance of risks on inflation had shifted substantially since early in the year. At that time, the economy had seemed sluggish and inflation was seen as possibly easing, but more recent developments indicated that the economy was stronger and rising inflation down the road could not be ruled out. Nonetheless, while policy might need to be firmed at some point to head off emerging inflation pressures, financial conditions were not so obviously stimulative as to counsel a need for any immediate tightening of policy. The real federal funds rate probably was not greatly out of line with its appropriate level, and the rise in longer-term interest rates and the exchange rate meant that financial conditions were now exerting more restraint than earlier this year. More information might provide a better sense of how the higher interest rates were affecting aggregate demand and perhaps also help--to a small degree--to shed light on the considerable uncertainties surrounding the relationship of output to inflation. In any event, actual inflation data--apart from food and energy prices--and many of the usual early warning signs of mounting price pressures did not yet indicate a pickup in the underlying trend of prices. Accordingly, the members viewed policy as appropriately positioned under current circumstances, though ongoing developments would need to be reassessed at the upcoming meeting in early July. Some members noted that the Committee would need to anticipate, and act to preclude, a rise in the core rate of inflation that, if it were to materialize, would be difficult and costly to reverse. In this regard. the view was expressed that a firming in policy sooner rather than later was likely to end up promoting stability in output and prices. "]
