[' In their discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that the economy had been stronger this year than they had anticipated and appeared to be growing at a quite robust pace. However, they generally expected the expansion to slow, keeping the economy close to its potential. Views differed to some extent with regard to the risks surrounding such an outlook. Some saw those risks as fairly evenly balanced, given prospective restraint from the rise in bond yields and the foreign exchange value of the dollar since early this year. Others expressed concern that economic growth might continue at a pace that could increase pressures on resources, with adverse implications for inflation in an economy already operating in the neighborhood of its estimated long-term potential. Moreover, faster increases in energy and food prices could contribute to higher overall inflation, both directly and by boosting inflationary expectations, and the proposed increase in the minimum wage would add to cost pressures if it were enacted into law. Nonetheless, while the chances of a pickup in inflation later had risen to some extent, a number of members emphasized that no firm evidence had surfaced thus far to signal that labor compensation was increasing at a faster rate or that core inflation was worsening, and even the early signs of increased pressures on costs and prices were mixed. The last few years had witnessed significantly lower cost pressures and more subdued inflation than typically would have been experienced in earlier years with similar rates of resource utilization, but whether this favorable outcome would persist was an open question.
