[' Industrial production rebounded in April from an appreciable decline in March. The changes in industrial output over the two-month period largely reflected fluctuations in motor vehicle assemblies associated with a strike and its subsequent settlement. Manufacturing of products other than motor vehicles rose moderately in April on the strength of further large advances in the output of office and computing equipment and of construction supplies. Utilization of total industrial capacity, which had varied in recent months in concert with movements in production, climbed in April to a rate slightly above that of the fourth quarter of 1995. ']
