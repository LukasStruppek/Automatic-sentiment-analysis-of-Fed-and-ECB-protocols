[" Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period, and the federal funds rate averaged near 5-1/4 percent, the level expected to be associated with that unchanged policy stance. Other short-term market interest rates changed little over the period, and because the Committee's decision had been largely anticipated in financial markets, longer-term rates also were little changed initially. Over the remainder of the period, however, intermediate- and long-term rates came under upward pressure when incoming economic data were seen by market participants as pointing to stronger growth in output and employment and therefore to a somewhat tighter monetary policy stance than previously had been expected. Despite the increase in bond yields, most indexes of stock prices rose on balance over the intermeeting period, apparently reflecting generally favorable first-quarter earnings reports and the improved economic outlook.
