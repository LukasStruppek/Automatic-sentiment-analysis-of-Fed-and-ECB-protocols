[' Business inventories declined in March after rising appreciably on average over January and February; inventory accumulation over the quarter as a whole was of modest proportions, as firms sought to bring stocks into better balance with sales. In manufacturing, inventories changed little in March and the ratio of stocks to sales was not far above historical lows. In the wholesale sector, inventories declined a little further in March, reflecting a reduction in stocks of motor vehicles, and the inventory-sales ratio remained near the middle of its range in recent years. Retail inventories also declined in March, with cuts in stocks of motor vehicles more than accounting for the drop. The inventory-sales ratio for the retail sector was near the low end of its range in recent years. ']
