[' Also of concern to the members were the possible effects on inflation of continued pressures on resources, especially if the current pace of the expansion should fail to moderate as much as projected. In recent years, the relationship between resource use and inflation had not followed earlier patterns. In particular, increases in labor compensation had been comparatively subdued over an extended period of what seemed to be relatively full employment highlighted by anecdotal reports of scarcities of various types of labor in numerous parts of the country. In part, worker willingness to accept compara- tively limited increases in compensation could be attributed to the apparent rise in insecurity about the permanence of jobs or the availability of alternative jobs, but the reasons were not fully understood. From the standpoint of the inflation outlook, it therefore was uncertain how long the period of relatively restrained increases in labor compensation would last. Against this background, a number of members indicated that they perceived an appreciable risk of rising labor costs and related inflation, even though there was little evidence to date of such developments; others noted that they could not rule out the possibility that the favorable experience would be extended.
