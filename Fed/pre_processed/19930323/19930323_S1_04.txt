[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding at a more moderate pace in the early months of 1993 after increasing substantially in the fourth quarter. Although outlays for business equipment apparently remained on a strong upward trajectory, sales of new homes had slackened and consumer spending was rising less rapidly. Indicators of production activity also were mixed: Industrial output had continued to post solid gains, but homebuilding had been less robust since year-end. Payroll employment had strengthened, and the unemployment rate had moved down further. Increases in wages had remained subdued in recent months, but advances in consumer and producer prices had been larger than those recorded in the latter part of 1992. ']
