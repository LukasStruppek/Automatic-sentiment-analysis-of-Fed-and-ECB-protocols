[' Members continued to report somewhat uneven business conditions across the nation. Steady economic growth characterized many parts of the country, but business activity remained depressed in some areas and industries, notably those related to defense, aerospace, and nonresidential construction. While business sentiment was generally positive, many business contacts were uncertain about the outlook for demand in their own industries or the potential strength of the overall expansion, and recent fiscal policy developments appeared to have introduced a further note of caution. This uncertainty helped to account for the continuing reliance of numerous firms on overtime work to meet growing demand rather than incurring the considerable costs of adding new workers. Even so, an increasing number of contacts were reporting worker recalls or new hires. One member commented that job growth could be viewed both as a measure of business sentiment and as a necessary element in building or maintaining consumer confidence and thus helping to ensure an enduring economic expansion.
