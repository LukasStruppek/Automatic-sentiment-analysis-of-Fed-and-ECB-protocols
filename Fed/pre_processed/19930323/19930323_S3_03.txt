[' The quickening recovery during 1992, especially in the second half of the year, had received considerable impetus from consumer spending, and while growth in such spending could be expected to moderate from its pace in recent quarters, the consumer sector was viewed as likely to play a key role in sustaining the expansion this year. Many consumers had taken advantage of steep declines in interest rates to strengthen their balance sheets and reduce their debt service burdens, and they were now in a much improved position to finance further growth in their expenditures. The members took note of recent indications of a decline in consumer confidence and of some softening in retail sales since early in the year. However, the latter appeared to be in part the result of recently adverse weather conditions in some major parts of the country, and consumer confidence was still much improved on balance since earlier in the recovery. Accordingly, recent developments were not seen in themselves as harbingers of a weakening consumer spending trend over the next several quarters. ']
