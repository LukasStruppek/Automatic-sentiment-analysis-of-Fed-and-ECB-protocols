[' The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity would grow over the year ahead at a pace that would foster a further gradual reduction in margins of unemployed labor and capital. The projection incorporated the essential elements of the fiscal proposals recently set forth by the Administration; the effects on aggregate demand, all other things equal, were expected to be small over the next several quarters. However, the appreciable declines in long-term interest rates that had occurred in recent months--evidently partly in response to anticipations of intermediate-term deficit reduction--were expected to support substantial additional gains in business and residential investment. Consumer spending would be bolstered by the progress already achieved in reducing debt service burdens and by a gradual lessening of concerns regarding job security, although the higher personal income taxes now envisioned for upper-income taxpayers were expected to be an inhibiting factor. Increases in export demand would be limited in the near term by the continuing weakness in the economies of the major industrialized countries. The persisting slack in resource utilization was expected to be associated with a return to more subdued price increases after a spurt earlier this year. ']
