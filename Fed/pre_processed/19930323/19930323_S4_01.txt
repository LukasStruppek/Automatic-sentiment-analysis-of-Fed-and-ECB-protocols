[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, most of the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged degree of pressure on reserve positions, while two members supported an immediate move to tighten reserve conditions. In the majority view, the current degree, of reserve pressure continued to represent a policy stance that was appropriately balanced in light of the opposing risks of a faltering economic expansion and a resurgence of inflation. Conditions in credit markets did not provide confirming evidence of the emergence of greater inflationary pressures and the need to restrain the growth in credit. Indeed, the continuation of balance sheet restructuring activities by financial institutions and the associated caution on the part of these institutions with regard to extending loans still appeared to be exerting a significantly inhibiting effect on the overall growth in spending and economic activity. Several members acknowledged that a policy of maintaining unchanged reserve conditions and an associated federal funds rate around current levels, which implied that real short-term rates were near zero or even slightly negative, could have inflationary consequences in the event of a strengthening of the expansion and a sustained pickup in credit demands. The Committee would need to remain alert to such a development. In present circumstances, however, an unchanged policy stance seemed most consistent with achieving sustained economic expansion in an environment of subdued inflation. The members who favored a prompt move toward restraint were persuaded that a steady policy incurred an unacceptable risk of halting the progress toward price stability and indeed of intensifying inflation as the current expansion matured. In this view, a policy tightening move at this point was likely to counter the need for more substantial and potentially disruptive tightening actions later. "]
