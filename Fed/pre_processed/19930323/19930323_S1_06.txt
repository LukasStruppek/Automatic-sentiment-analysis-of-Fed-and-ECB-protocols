[' Industrial production continued to rise at a fairly brisk pace in January and February. Changes in mining and utilities were about offsetting on balance over the two months, but increases in manufacturing were fairly widespread. Although motor vehicle assemblies fell in February from a relatively high January level, the production of consumer durables and computers turned up sharply. In addition, increases in output were recorded in several other categories, including non-energy materials and construction supplies. Recent surveys indicated that new orders for durable goods increased further in February, and lean factory inventories coupled with reports of lengthening delivery times suggested further gains in industrial output in coming months. Total utilization of industrial capacity rose again in February. ']
