[" Mr. Angell also emphasized the risks associated with any policy that did not firmly maintain a disinflationary trend. As he interpreted historical precedents, the typical result of a policy that tolerated some inflation was an eventual rise in inflation leading to permanently higher interest rates with adverse effects on economic activity. Indeed, he supported unpegging the federal funds rate to counter incipient price pressures showing through in commodity and finished goods prices. He believed that a clear signal of the Committee's commitment to price level stability would stabilize the price of gold along with the exchange value of the dollar and thereby provide a climate for further reductions in long-and intermediate-term interest rates. Such an approach to policy not only would assure a continuing disinflationary trend and eventual price stability, with very favorable implications for financial markets and economic growth, but it would in his view preclude an unsettling tendency for the debt markets to weaken every time newly available data appeared to suggest that economic growth was strengthening and that further monetary policy tightening actions therefore might be in the offing. In sum, such a policy would provide for the achievement of the Committee's objective of sustaining progress toward price stability which he believed was necessary for maintaining recent higher labor productivity, a permanently higher savings rate, and a prolonged period of economic expansion.
