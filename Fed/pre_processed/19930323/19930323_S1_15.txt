[' In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fell on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar depreciated through late February, partly in response to declines in U.S. long-term interest rates and incoming data that were seen as pointing to some slowing of the expansion in the United States. Subsequently, the dollar rebounded in the wake of unexpectedly strong U.S. employment statistics, disappointing inflation numbers, and further signs of weakening economic activity abroad. Near the end of the period, the dollar again dropped against the German mark and other European currencies, following a cut by the Bundesbank of its discount rate that apparently was less than market participants were expecting. On balance over the period, the dollar was marginally lower against the mark and other European currencies, but it declined substantially against the Japanese yen, reaching an all-time low. ']
