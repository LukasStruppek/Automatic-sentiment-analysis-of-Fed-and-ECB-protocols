[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, the members remained encouraged by recent developments that they viewed on the whole as tending to confirm their forecasts of sustained economic expansion, though at a pace appreciably below that now indicated for the fourth quarter of 1992. If realized, such economic growth would be associated over time with a further gradual decline in unemployment. While the expansion appeared to have generated some momentum, a number of factors were likely to limit its strength, including ongoing balance sheet and business restructuring activities, the outlook for a more restrictive federal budget, and continuing weakness in key foreign markets. At the same time, greatly reduced interest rates and much improved, if still vulnerable, business and consumer confidence were positive factors in the outlook. Some members cautioned that even though a moderate rate of economic growth could be viewed as the most likely outcome over the forecast horizon, the current expansion differed in important respects from earlier cyclical recoveries and in light of the attendant uncertainties a considerably different result--in either direction--could not be ruled out. With regard to the outlook for inflation, the faster increases in consumer prices in recent months and a sharp upturn in the prices of certain producer materials tended to raise concerns, or at least a degree of unease, with regard to underlying inflation trends. While these developments might well prove to be an aberration rather than a signal of intensifying inflation, they did suggest the need to reassess the likelihood of a further decline in inflation and to be alert to further signs of a sustained upturn. For now, however, the favorable trends in underlying unit labor costs, which were associated in turn with ongoing gains in productivity and the absence of any firming in wage pressures, led many members to conclude that recent price developments did not provide persuasive evidence of a change in the inflation outlook.
