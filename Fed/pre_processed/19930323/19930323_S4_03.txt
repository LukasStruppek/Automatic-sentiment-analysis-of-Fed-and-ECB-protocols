[" In the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting adjustments to the degree of reserve pressure, members who favored an unchanged policy stance also expressed a preference for retaining the symmetry of the existing directive. Some observed that a policy change during the intermeeting period, if any, might well be in the direction of a tightening move. However, because there was no compelling case in the view of most members for such a move at this time and any intermeeting adjustment would be made in the light of emerging developments, a symmetric directive was warranted. In this connection, one member commented that, given the Committee's assessment of current economic and financial conditions, a tilt in the directive toward restraint would give a misleading indication of the Committee's current intentions. Members also noted that a change in policy, should one be called for by intermeeting developments, would represent a shift in the direction of policy and would be likely to have an especially pronounced impact on financial markets.
