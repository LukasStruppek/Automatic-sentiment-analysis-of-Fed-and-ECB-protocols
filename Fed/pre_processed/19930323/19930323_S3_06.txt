[' The members agreed that the prospects for overall spending on business capital goods and housing were vulnerable to shifts in attitudes that might be triggered, for example, by increases in market interest rates associated with an absence of progress in reducing the federal budget deficit. The outlook for a significant contraction in the federal deficit was subject to considerable uncertainty, especially in light of the still pending decisions to be made with regard to health care programs and their financing. The members recognized that the direct effects of appreciable deficit reduction would tend to constrain economic activity, as evidenced by the impact in many areas of the defense cutbacks that were already being implemented. Business contacts had expressed concerns about the potential effects on their industries and local markets of various provisions in the proposed legislation. Even so, a more encompassing assessment of the effects of deficit reduction needed to take account of its favorable implications for domestic interest rates. Moreover, insofar as the nearer-term outlook was concerned, the fiscal legislation now under consideration included new spending initiatives and the investment tax credit that were intended to provide some temporary stimulus to an economic expansion that, in the view of many observers, might still be in the process of gathering sustainable momentum. On balance, substantial deficit reduction in line with the currently proposed legislation was seen as likely to have a positive effect on business and consumer confidence, financial markets, and the longer-term health of the economy.
