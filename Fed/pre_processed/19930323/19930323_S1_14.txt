[' Other short-term interest rates changed little over the intermeeting period, while long-term rates fell appreciably on balance. Bond markets rallied over most of the period, reflecting market assessments of improved prospects for significant reductions in the federal budget deficit in coming years and the consequences for overall spending. Prices of Treasury notes and bonds also were boosted by municipal defeasance activity and by perceptions of heightened prepayment risks in mortgage-backed securities. In early March, interest rates on long-term Treasury bonds and conventional fixed-rate mortgages reached their lowest levels since 1973, but some of the decline in bond and mortgage rates subsequently was reversed in response to increased apprehension about inflation. Equity prices generally responded favorably to the drop in long-term interest rates, but concerns about future changes in government policy toward a number of industries, including health care, led to lower prices in some segments of the equities market.
