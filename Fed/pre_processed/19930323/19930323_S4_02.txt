[" In the course of the Committee discussion, the members took account of a staff analysis that pointed to a resumption of M2 and M3 growth over the months ahead. This analysis suggested that the temporary factors depressing the broader monetary aggregates likely would be reversing, but that the other influences causing a rechanneling of credit flows away from depository institutions and boosting the velocity of money undoubtedly would persist, though probably with diminishing force. Accordingly, the staff foresaw moderate growth of M2 and M3 that at midyear would leave these aggregates below the lower ends of the Committee's ranges for 1993. Under prevailing circumstances, such continuing weakness in the broader aggregates was not viewed as indicating inadequate monetary stimulus. Indeed, a number of members commented that other indicators suggested that current monetary policy was in fact quite accommodative as evidenced for example by low short-term interest rates, especially on an inflation-adjusted basis. Moreover, Ml, reserves, and the monetary base had continued to expand in the first quarter, though at much reduced rates. One member commented that the slowdown in these narrower monetary measures, which he viewed as important indicators of the thrust of monetary policy, had favorable implications with regard to bringing inflation under control. The members agreed that the considerable uncertainty that continued to surround the outlook for broad money relative to spending implied that forming precise expectations for monetary growth over the months ahead was not feasible.
