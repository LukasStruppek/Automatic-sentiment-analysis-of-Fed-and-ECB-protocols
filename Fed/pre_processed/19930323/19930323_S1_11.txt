[" Producer prices of finished goods were up in January and February after changing little over the fourth quarter. Producer prices of finished foods declined over the first two months of the year, but prices of finished energy products climbed rapidly, and prices of other finished items rose at a faster rate than in 1992. At the consumer level, price increases in January and February also were on the high side of the past year's advances. Food prices jumped in January and rose slightly further in February, while energy prices retraced most of a sharp January rise. Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices advanced at a substantially faster pace over the January-February period than in 1992. Increases in wages, as measured by average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers, remained subdued in recent months. The advance in average hourly earnings slowed in February, and the rise over the twelve months ended in February was considerably smaller than over the previous twelve-month period. "]
