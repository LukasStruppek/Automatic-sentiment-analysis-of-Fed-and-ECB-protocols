[" Members preferring a somewhat higher M2 range emphasized that expectations for growth of this aggregate in 1995 and 1996 were around the upper end of the current range. In their view, under the Federal Reserve Act, the Committee's target ranges--and normally their midpoints--should be consistent with the Committee's expectations for growth in nominal GDP and money. From this perspective, a higher M2 range was clearly defensible and the reasons for it easily communicated. Indeed, a failure to adjust the range upward could be interpreted by observers as indicating an intent to tighten policy should M2 growth remain high in relation to its current range. "]
