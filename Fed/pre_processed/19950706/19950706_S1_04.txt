[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the level of economic activity was about unchanged in the second quarter. Consumer spending apparently remained sluggish, and business spending on plant and equipment rose less rapidly than in other recent quarters. With final sales flagging, firms sought to hold down production and employment in order to keep inventories under control. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices had increased faster on balance thus far this year, but signs of some moderation in inflation were evident in recent price data. Growth of labor compensation costs remained subdued. ']
