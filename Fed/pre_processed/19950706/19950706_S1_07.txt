[' Nominal retail sales were about unchanged over April and May. Purchases at furniture and appliance stores were up slightly on balance over the two months. Sales at automotive dealerships and apparel outlets fell in April but revived somewhat in May. Spending at building materials stores fell in both months. The retail sales reports, in combination with data on consumer prices and unit motor-vehicle sales, suggested that inflation-adjusted spending for consumer goods had changed little since the fourth quarter of last year. Housing starts were unchanged on balance over April and May; a reduction in starts of single-family homes was offset by a rise in starts of multifamily units. Adverse weather in some parts of the country might have contributed to the sluggishness in starts. Home sales were higher in May: Sales of new homes turned up sharply, and sales of existing homes also advanced somewhat. ']
