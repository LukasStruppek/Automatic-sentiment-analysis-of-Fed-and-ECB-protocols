[' Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. The federal funds rate generally remained near 6 percent, but most short-term interest rates were down on balance in response to incoming economic data, particularly the employment report for May, that were seen by market participants as increasing the likelihood that monetary policy would be eased in the near future. Longer-term interest rates also declined in reaction to growing indications that efforts to narrow substantially the U.S. budget deficit might be successful. Yields on corporate and municipal obligations fell less than Treasury rates and risk spreads widened a little, particularly for junk bonds. Major indexes of equity prices rose over the intermeeting period, partly in response to lower interest rates. ']
