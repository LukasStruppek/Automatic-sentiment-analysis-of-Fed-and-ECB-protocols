[' Growth of M2 strengthened substantially in May and June. Downward adjustments in returns on deposits and retail money fund shares had lagged declines in market interest rates in recent months, and investors evidently responded by shifting funds from market instruments into these M2 assets. For the year through June, M2 expanded at a rate in the upper half of its range for 1995. M3 also accelerated in May and June; and for the year through June, this aggregate grew at a rate well above the annual range set in February. The pickup in M3 growth importantly reflected more rapid inflows to institution-only money funds, whose yields also adjusted sluggishly to falling money market rates. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had grown at a rate in the upper half of its monitoring range in recent months. ']
