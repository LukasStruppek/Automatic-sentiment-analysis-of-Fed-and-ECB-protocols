[" Members who leaned toward an unchanged policy remained concerned about the persistence of inflationary pressures and whether a somewhat easier policy stance would be consistent with the objective of capping inflation and setting the stage for further progress toward price stability. The available evidence on the economy's current performance remained mixed and most forecasts pointed to moderate strengthening ahead; in the circumstances an easing move did not appear to be needed at this time. One member emphasized that, while the risks of greater inflation seemed small, the costs of a policy error in the direction of too much easing would be high in terms of its effects on the credibility of the System's anti-inflationary policy and the need to rein in inflationary growth next year. Although their preference would be to wait for further evidence on the performance of the economy, all but one of these members indicated that, given the current uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook and the small amount of easing that was proposed, they would not dissent from the majority position.
