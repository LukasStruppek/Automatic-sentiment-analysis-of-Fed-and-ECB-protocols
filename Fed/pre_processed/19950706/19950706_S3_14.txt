[' With regard to M3, all the members indicated that they preferred or could accept an increase in its range to 2 to 6 percent for both years. The current 0 to 4 percent range was quite low in relation to the range for M2, judging by the average historical growth of this aggregate relative to that of M2. The range had been adopted in the light of unusual developments that had depressed M3 growth over much of the 1990s. Those developments, which also had served to curb M2 growth though to a lesser extent, involved a reduced role of banking institutions in the intermediation of flows of funds between savers and borrowers. That reduced role had been induced to a large degree by balance sheet adjustments undertaken in response to extraordinary strains experienced by banks and thrifts. Against the background of favorable economic developments, the financial health of depository institutions had improved markedly over the last few years, and the increased ability and willingness of these institutions to serve as financial intermediaries appeared to be working toward strengthening the growth of M3 and lowering its velocity. In the circumstances, the members believed that the contemplated increase in the M3 range was essentially a technical response to developments that were tending to restore both traditional financing patterns and the historical pattern of somewhat faster growth in M3 than in M2. In this respect, the increase in the M3 range did not have any implications for the underlying thrust of monetary policy, though the higher range could prove to be more consistent over time with sustainable and noninflationary economic growth. As in the case of the current M2 range, that conclusion assumed the eventual restoration of historic relationships between M3 and measures of overall economic performance. ']
