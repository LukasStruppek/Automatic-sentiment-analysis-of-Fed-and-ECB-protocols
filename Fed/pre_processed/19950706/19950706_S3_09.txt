[' The members generally agreed that the inflation risks in the economy had diminished, though some still saw the potential for little or no progress in unwinding the recent uptick in inflation. Many referred to indications of easing pressures on resources in recent months, and they generally felt that such pressures would be contained over the projection horizon if economic growth were to materialize in line with their forecasts. Developments seen as consistent with such an expectation included persisting anecdotal reports of highly competitive markets that made it very difficult for business firms to pass on cost increases or to raise profit margins. Moreover, despite continuing reports of labor scarcities in some areas and industries, increases in nominal labor costs generally had remained subdued across the nation. Prices of many raw materials and semi-finished goods had increased sharply in earlier months and these increases would continue to put upward pressure on the prices of finished goods, but there recently had been signs of some abatement of inflation at the earlier stages of production. Similarly, earlier declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were placing upward pressure on the prices of many imported products, but the recent stability of the dollar promised a diminution of such pressure over time. On balance, most of the members believed that the underlying trend of inflation was now tilted toward gradual deceleration in the context of marginally higher rates of unemployed labor and other resources, but they acknowledged that the risks to such an outcome remained substantial.
