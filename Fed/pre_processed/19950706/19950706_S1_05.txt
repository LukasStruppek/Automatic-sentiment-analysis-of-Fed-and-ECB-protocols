[' Nonfarm payroll employment fell substantially in May after a small decline in April and reduced gains in the first quarter. Payrolls in the services industry continued to rise in May, but the pace of hiring was well below the average rate of increase over other recent months. In manufacturing and construction, employment contracted further in May, although part of the job decline in construction might have been temporary, reflecting heavy rains and floods in the South. The civilian unemployment rate edged lower in May, to 5.7 percent, but was somewhat above its average for the first quarter. ']
