[' In the course of the discussion, members indicated that much of the economic information that had become available since the May meeting had suggested a greater softening in the economy than they had anticipated and had raised concerns about the timing and strength of the upturn over coming quarters. However, the most recent data and some of the anecdotal reports from around the country had a better tone. Among the positive factors in the economic outlook, members gave particular emphasis to the favorable financial climate, including the stimulative effects of lower interest rates on interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, the ready availability of financing from market sources and banking institutions, and the impact of rising equity and bond prices on balance sheets. Business and consumer sentiment also remained generally favorable, though anecdotal reports suggested a heightened degree of caution among business contacts in many parts of the nation. Members observed that the expansion did not appear to have produced overall imbalances in the economy aside from an apparent overhang of inventories in some industries. The ongoing adjustments needed to bring these inventories down to desired levels were seen as the most serious threat to the expansion. Some members commented that the inventory correction in the second quarter appeared on the basis of the available evidence to be less than was expected earlier and that the period of inventory adjustment might therefore be more extended in time than they had anticipated. While such a development might not in itself be sufficient to tilt the economy into recession, in the possible context of relatively sluggish growth in final demands, the economy would be vulnerable to adverse domestic or external shocks. On balance, while the timing remained uncertain, a resumption of growth at a moderate rate was viewed as a likely prospect, given the underlying strength of the economy. ']
