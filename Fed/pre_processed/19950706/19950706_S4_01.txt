[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, nearly all the members indicated that they favored or could support a proposal to ease slightly the current degree of pressure on reserve positions. Preferences for an unchanged policy stance and for somewhat greater easing also were expressed. In support of at least slight easing, members commented that they viewed current monetary policy as somewhat restrictive, judged in part by the level of the inflation-adjusted federal funds rate. This degree of monetary restraint had been appropriate early in the year when the economy was operating at or possibly beyond its long-run potential and inflation pressures appeared to be mounting. Some modest easing was desirable now that the growth of the economy had slowed considerably more than anticipated and potential inflationary pressures seemed to be in the process of receding. Although inflation was higher than in 1994 and the economy was still operating at an elevated level, looking forward many members saw prospects for declining inflation and the possibility of shortfalls in economic growth. The members agreed that under present economic conditions a slight easing of the stance of policy would incur little risk of stimulating increased inflation and would be entirely consistent with their commitment to continued progress toward price stability over time. Several members also observed that any move toward less restraint should be cautious at this point because easing would represent a change in the direction of policy and its repercussions on financial markets, including the foreign exchange markets, could be relatively pronounced.
