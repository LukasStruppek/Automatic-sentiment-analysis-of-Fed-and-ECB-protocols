[' A few members preferred somewhat greater easing. They stressed that such a move was warranted by the recent pause in the expansion and the apparent vulnerability of the economy to a variety of downside risks. Indeed, a move from what they saw as a restrictive monetary policy toward a more neutral policy stance was somewhat overdue in their view. While they could support a slight adjustment to policy at this point, these members were persuaded that the stance of monetary policy probably would need to be eased by more than a slight amount over time to accommodate the intermediate- and long-term needs of an expanding economy. Moreover, the risks of increasing inflationary pressures appeared to be relatively remote in the context of the current and anticipated performance of the overall economy. The declines in intermediate- and long-term interest rates were helping to support the expansion, but those declines rested in part on market expectations of significant monetary policy easing; failure to ratify such expectations could well result in at least a partial reversal of those desirably lower rates.
