Based on the limited information available, business investment in equipment and software seemed to be advancing at a solid pace in the third quarter. This reflected an acceleration in spending that was associated importantly with notably stronger motor vehicle sales and a halt to the contraction in aircraft expenditures. Outside the transportation sector, outlays on equipment continued to expand at a moderate pace; in addition, the level of orders in July (latest data) moved above shipments for the first time since early last year, and the backlog of unfilled orders edged up. Nonresidential construction activity remained on a steep downtrend in July, with further reductions of spending in all major categories except office buildings.
