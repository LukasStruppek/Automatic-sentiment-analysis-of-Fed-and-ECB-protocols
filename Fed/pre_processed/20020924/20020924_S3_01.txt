In the Committee’s discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that economic growth appeared to have picked up in the third quarter but that the most recent information had been mixed, raising questions about whether the pace of the expansion going forward would be strong enough to erode margins of underutilized labor and capital resources. For now, a high degree of business caution in the context of substantial uncertainties, exacerbated recently by apparently increased concerns about the geopolitical outlook, continued to restrain business investment and hiring. Even so, the economy appeared to be well positioned for solid gains over time in light of the progress that had been made in bringing inventories and capital stocks into better alignment with sales, the stimulus provided by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, and the implications of the strong uptrend in productivity for profitable investment opportunities and growth in consumer incomes. With the growth of economic activity nonetheless expected to remain below the economy’s potential for some time, pressures on labor and other resources would be limited and in turn wage and price increases likely would continue to edge lower.
