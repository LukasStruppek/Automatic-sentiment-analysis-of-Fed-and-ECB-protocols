The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that the economy continued to expand in the third quarter, though the tenor of incoming reports was mixed. Data on household and business spending had been solid for the most part, and residential construction remained high. Motor vehicle production provided a sizable boost to economic activity, but other factory output changed little on net. Employment continued to expand unevenly, while labor productivity remained on a strong upward trend. Overall price inflation had fallen over the past year, reflecting favorable developments in the food and energy sectors and a decline in core inflation.
