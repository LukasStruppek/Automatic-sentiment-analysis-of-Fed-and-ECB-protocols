Aggregate labor market conditions had been mixed in recent months. While nonfarm payroll employment registered further small gains in July and August, the aggregate hours worked by production or nonsupervisory workers declined on balance over the two-month period. The manufacturing and retail trade sectors registered sharp job losses in August, but those were more than offset by hiring in the services and construction sectors. A hefty increase in government jobs at the federal, state, and local levels also boosted payroll employment. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.7 percent in August despite advances in claims for unemployment insurance.
