Residential housing activity slowed a little in July and August from the robust pace of the second quarter as further declines in mortgage rates apparently helped to support housing activity in an environment of sluggish employment and diminishing household wealth. Starts of single-family units fell in August to their lowest rate since last November, while starts in the multifamily sector in the July-August period were at their average rate for the first half of the year. Sales of new single-family homes posted a record high in July, and the inventory of unsold new homes remained low. Sales of existing single-family homes in July partially retraced a large drop in June.
