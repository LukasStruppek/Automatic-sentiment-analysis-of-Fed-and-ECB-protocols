In the context of limited demand pressures on labor and other resources, current forecasts continued to point to quite low and perhaps declining inflation over the next several quarters, although there appeared to be significant crosscurrents in the outlook for prices. Rapid increases in healthcare and other insurance costs and the lagged passthrough of large increases in oil prices would tend to maintain upward pressure on prices. Tending to oppose those forces, though, were the effects on resource use of an extended period of economic activity below the economyâ€™s potential as well as the effects of robust productivity gains on costs, apparently declining inflation expectations, and the persistent absence of pricing power in highly competitive markets. Indeed, the members did not rule out the emergence of appreciably lower inflation. In this regard, some observed that a significant decline in inflation from current levels could imply an unwelcome tightening of monetary policy in real terms. In addition, further sizable disinflation that resulted in a nominal inflation rate near zero could create problems for the implementation of monetary policy through conventional means in the event of an adverse shock to the economy that called for negative real policy interest rates.
