Messrs. Gramlich and McTeer dissented because they preferred to ease monetary policy at this meeting. The economic expansion, which resumed almost a year ago, had recently lost momentum, and job growth had been minimal over the past year. With inflation already low and likely to decline further in the face of economic slack and rapid productivity growth, the potential cost of additional stimulus seemed low compared with the risk of further weakness.
