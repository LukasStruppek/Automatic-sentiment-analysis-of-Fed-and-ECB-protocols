Business fixed investment remained a significant question mark in the outlook for economic expansion. Recent readings on business spending for equipment and software pointed to gradual improvement, but nonresidential construction activity continued to be severely depressed in many areas. It was unclear whether the recent strength in orders and shipments signaled a significant acceleration in capital outlays, and in this regard the new information that would become available in the next few weeks might provide important evidence on the outlook for capital spending and thus for the performance of the economy more generally. At least for now, however, anecdotal reports suggested that a high degree of caution continued to characterize business investment decisions in the face of an elevated level of uncertainty. Much of the current spending for equipment and software reportedly represented replacement demand largely associated with the short useful lives of various types of equipment, and there appeared to be little spending that would entail capital deepening. At the same time, several positive factors in the outlook for capital spending could be cited including the greater productivity of new capital equipment, the temporary accelerated expensing tax incentives, generally strong business cash positions, and the relatively rapid depreciation of existing capital equipment. For the present, however, business contacts widely reported that because of prevailing uncertainties they were deferring major investment initiatives until they saw clear evidence of an increased need for capital to meet growing demand.
