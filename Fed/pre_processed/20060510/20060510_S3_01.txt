In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants saw the economy as having rebounded strongly so far this year after the slowing of growth in the fourth quarter. The advance in output had been vigorous in the first quarter of this year, with real GDP increasing at around a 5 percent annual rate. Although the expansion appeared likely to moderate, it evidently remained solid. Inflation pressures appeared to be somewhat greater than the Committee had anticipated at the time of its March meeting. Consumer prices recently had risen at a pace noticeably above the average rise over the previous twelve months. Also, prices of energy and many other commodities had climbed sharply of late, and inflation expectations appeared to have risen slightly. If economic growth continued to moderate over coming quarters, as anticipated, pressures on productive resources would most likely continue to be limited. Most participants expected that, after allowing for some possible near-term volatility related to the recent jump in energy and other commodity prices, core inflation would probably remain around the levels experienced on average over the past year. However, recent developments suggested that upside risks to inflation had risen somewhat since the time of the March meeting.
