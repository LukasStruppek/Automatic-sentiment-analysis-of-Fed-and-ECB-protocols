Headline inflation turned up in March. Although the price of natural gas had fallen because of continued plentiful inventories, retail gasoline prices surged, leading to a jump in overall energy prices for the month. Prices of core goods and services also rose more quickly in March, largely because of a spike in the apparel component that unwound a decline in February and a one-time step-up in medical prices related to changes in Medicare reimbursement rules. During the twelve months ending in March, overall inflation rose at a slightly faster pace than that in the preceding twelve-month period, while core prices for the same period increased a bit more slowly than in the previous year. Producer price inflation also moved up in March, driven largely by higher food and energy prices. Readings on the growth in the cost of labor were mixed. Over the three months ending in March, the employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers rose at its slowest pace in several years. Data on compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector, however, pointed toward notably faster growth in the first quarter. Some financial-market and survey indicators suggested that inflation expectations, both for the upcoming year and for the longer term, had moved up since the March meeting.
