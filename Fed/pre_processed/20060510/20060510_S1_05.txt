Nonfarm payrolls increased by 138,000 jobs in April following robust growth in March. The gains in April were widespread: Manufacturing and related industries registered significant increases, mining activity and employment were boosted by rising energy prices, construction hiring posted a moderate gain, and a range of services-producing industries strengthened, with the important exception of retail trade, which more than reversed its March gains. Average hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls edged up in April. The increases in the workweek and employment in April led to notable growth in aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.7 percent in March and remained at that level in April.
