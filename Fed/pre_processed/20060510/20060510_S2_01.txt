The staff forecast prepared for this meeting showed real GDP growth moderating somewhat from the average pace of the previous several quarters. The projected deceleration of real GDP reflected the lagged effects of the tightening of monetary policy, the waning impetus from increases in household wealth, and reduced stimulus from fiscal policy. While higher energy prices were expected to boost inflation in the near term, structural productivity was strong, and the influence of higher energy and material costs was thought likely to moderate. Thus, consumer prices, after increasing at a faster rate in the first half of the year, were expected to decelerate later this year and next year.
