However, participants also cited some factors that could be expected to restrain inflation. Although alternative measures of labor compensation provided divergent readings, growth of total compensation on balance appeared to remain moderate. And, even if nominal wages should accelerate somewhat, relatively wide profit margins could buffer the effect on prices of final goods and services. While firms would seek to maintain those margins, recent experience suggested that this might be accomplished in part through further productivity gains, which had remained fairly strong on balance in recent quarters, rather than through more rapid price hikes.
