Industrial production in March expanded at about the same strong pace as it did in February, with gains posted across all major components of the index. Manufacturing activity picked up in March after a lull in February. While manufacturing growth for the first quarter as a whole slowed from the rapid pace of the fourth quarter, it exceeded that of the previous year. Manufacturing capacity utilization during the quarter was a bit above its long-run average. Mining output--which includes oil and natural gas extraction--strengthened in the first quarter as a whole. Within the quarter, however, the boost from hurricane-related recovery seemed to ebb. While utility output surged in February and moved up a bit more in March, these increases only partly reversed the weather-related plunge in January.
