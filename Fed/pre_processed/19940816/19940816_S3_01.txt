[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that final aggregate demand appeared to have slowed somewhat in recent months but that the expansion still seemed to have considerable underlying momentum. Indeed, available data on the various components of spending taken together might in fact be understating the growth in economic activity; the strength of labor markets and measures of gross domestic income suggested a somewhat stronger economic performance. Sustained expansion, perhaps at a pace broadly in line with or a bit above the economy's long-run growth potential, remained a reasonable expectation, but many members observed that they saw the risks as being on the upside of such a projection in the absence of some further policy tightening. Views varied to some degree with regard to available margins of unemployed resources, but the members agreed that the economy probably was operating very close to, and in the view of some might have reached, its long-run potential. In these circumstances, the members saw appreciable risks of intensifying pressures on resources and higher inflation. Broad measures of wages and prices suggested little change in inflation trends in recent quarters, but worrisome signs of greater inflation were evident in the prices of materials purchased by business firms and in anecdotal reports of successful efforts by an increasing number of businesses to pass on rising costs by raising prices.
