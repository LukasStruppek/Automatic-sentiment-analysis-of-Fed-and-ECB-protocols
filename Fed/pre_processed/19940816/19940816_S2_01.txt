[' The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy was operating close to its long-run capacity and that growth would trend lower over the next several quarters to a rate generally in line with the increase in its potential. Under these circumstances, trends in the core rate of inflation would not deviate significantly from recent experience, but there was a risk that such an outcome might require further monetary policy tightening. Growth in consumer spending was projected to slow in response to smaller gains in employment and income, some reductions in pent-up demands, and the adverse effects on household financial wealth of earlier increases in interest rates and declines in stock market prices. Business fixed investment, while remaining relatively brisk, was expected to decelerate somewhat over the forecast horizon, primarily owing to smaller projected gains in sales, a growing shortfall of corporate cash flow relative to capital outlays, and higher financing costs. Single-family housing construction would continue to be damped by the higher mortgage rates; however, the pace of homebuilding was expected to remain relatively robust compared with the rate of recent years, reflecting still unsatisfied demand for homeownership and the relatively favorable cash-flow affordability of housing, as judged by the standards of the past two decades. The restraint on economic activity exerted by weak export demand was projected to diminish as economic conditions improved abroad, given the competitiveness of U.S. produced goods. ']
