[' Business inventory investment slowed in June after a sharp acceleration in April and May; for the second quarter as a whole, inventories were up substantially but they appeared to have remained broadly in line with sales. In manufacturing, recent inventory buildups had been concentrated in a few industries where orders had been particularly strong. For manufacturing as a whole, the ratio of stocks to shipments declined from an already low level. At the wholesale level, the accumulation of inventories in the second quarter was largely in durable goods, which were in strong demand; the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector remained below the range that has prevailed in recent years. A large part of the buildup of retail inventories in the second quarter was in nondurable goods, especially in stocks of general merchandise. For the retail sector as a whole, the inventory-to-sales ratio at the end of June was near the high end of the range observed in recent years. ']
