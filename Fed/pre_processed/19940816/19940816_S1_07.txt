[' Growth in consumer spending had slowed in recent months, owing in part to constraints on the supply of motor vehicles. Nominal retail sales edged lower in July after expanding at a slightly reduced pace in the second quarter. Sales at general merchandise and furniture and appliance stores increased further in July, while purchases at apparel outlets were down after large June increases. Sales at automotive dealerships fell appreciably in July after edging lower in the second quarter; these sales declines apparently resulted in part from the inability of manufacturers to produce enough of the most popular models. Housing starts in July retraced part of a large June decline but remained below their elevated rate in the fourth quarter of 1993. ']
