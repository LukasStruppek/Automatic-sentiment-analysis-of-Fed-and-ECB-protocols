[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened slightly in May; for April and May combined, the deficit was significantly larger than in the first quarter. Exports of goods and services were about the same in May as in April, with increased shipments of machinery and industrial supplies offset by reduced exports of aircraft and gold. Imports of goods and services were slightly higher in May than in April. Most of the increase was in imports of oil, as a consequence of higher prices, and consumer goods. The economies of all the major foreign industrial countries continued to expand in the second quarter. Growth remained at a healthy pace in the United Kingdom and Canada and appeared to have firmed in continental Europe. In Japan, growth apparently slowed somewhat in the second quarter. ']
