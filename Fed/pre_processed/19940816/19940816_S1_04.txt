[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the pace of economic expansion, though still substantial, might have slowed somewhat recently. Consumer spending continued to post moderate gains, supported by rising labor income and favorable sentiment. Business outlays for plant and equipment remained on a steep uptrend, but higher interest rates seemed to be having some restraining effect on homebuilding activity. Resource utilization was at elevated levels, with factories operating at relatively high rates and labor markets evidencing very low levels of slack. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices had remained moderate in recent months, apart from the effects of short-run swings in the volatile food and energy components. ']
