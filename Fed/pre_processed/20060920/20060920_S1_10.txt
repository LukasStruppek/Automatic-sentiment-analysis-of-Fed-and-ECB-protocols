Economic activity in the advanced foreign economies decelerated in the second quarter but remained strong. A fall in net exports held back expansion in Japan and Canada, while strong domestic demand boosted growth in the United Kingdom and the euro area. Incoming data suggested that overall GDP growth in these countries for the current quarter was dropping a bit from the second-quarter pace. Recent economic indicators from the emerging-market economies generally pointed to robust, but moderating, growth.
