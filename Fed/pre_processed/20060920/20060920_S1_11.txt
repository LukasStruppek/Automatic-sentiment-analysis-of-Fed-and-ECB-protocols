The overall price index for personal consumption expenditures rose relatively steeply in July and was estimated to have increased further in August, bringing the advance over the twelve-month period above the year-earlier rise. After July, though, crude oil and gasoline prices dropped back significantly, and with inventories of natural gas remaining near seasonal highs, natural gas prices fell from their spike earlier this summer. Core consumer prices increased at a somewhat more subdued pace over July and August, but despite the recent moderation, the twelve-month change in core prices remained above the increase over the comparable period twelve months earlier. The producer price index for core intermediate materials rose significantly in July and August. Substantial upward revisions to wages and salaries boosted compensation per hour in the first quarter. The increase likely owed in part to the exercise of stock options and cash bonuses; other data that did not include such forms of compensation pointed to more moderate increases. Hourly compensation rose further in the second quarter and recorded an increase of about 7-3/4 percent from four quarters earlier. After more favorable readings in June and July, survey measures of households' inflation expectations turned back up in August, but preliminary September readings suggested a decline.
