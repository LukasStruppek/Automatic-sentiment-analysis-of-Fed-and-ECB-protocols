Nonfarm payrolls rose in August at a pace similar to that recorded over the previous four months. Employment gains were widespread in the service sector, and the construction industry also added jobs, particularly in nonresidential building. However, employment in retail trade and manufacturing fell again in August. Average hours of production or nonsupervisory workers edged lower. The unemployment rate ticked back down to 4.7 percent in August, but it remained within the narrow band that prevailed since the beginning of the year.
