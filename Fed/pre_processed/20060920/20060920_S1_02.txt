The information reviewed at the meeting suggested that economic activity continued to decelerate in recent months. Consumer and business spending held up well, and payroll employment continued to rise moderately in July and August. However, a contraction in homebuilding was damping the economic expansion. Core consumer price inflation eased somewhat but nonetheless remained higher than it was in 2005. Total consumer price inflation moderated in August, reflecting a substantial slowing of the increase in energy prices.
