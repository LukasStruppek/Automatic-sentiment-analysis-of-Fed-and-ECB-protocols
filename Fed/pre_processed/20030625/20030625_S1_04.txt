The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy continued to expand at a subpar pace in recent months. Consumer spending increased moderately, housing activity held at a high level, and government outlays grew substantially. Business investment, however, was still soft. Industrial production and employment appeared to have stabilized after an extended period of weakness. Consumer price inflation remained at a very low level.
