Orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods were lackluster in April and May. This sluggish performance followed a first-quarter decline in real outlays on equipment and software that had more than reversed the fourth-quarter gains. Excluding purchases of transportation equipment, however, outlays grew a bit over the first quarter. Real investment in nonresidential structures dropped further in that quarter, though the rate of decline slowed. Outlays for office buildings and industrial structures were down sharply, and falling rents and rising vacancy rates in April suggested further weakness in the second quarter.
