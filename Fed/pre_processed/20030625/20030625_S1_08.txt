Activity in the housing market was reasonably well maintained in April and May. Despite unusually wet weather in many areas, starts of single-family and multifamily units in the two months were just a little below their strong first-quarter levels. Building permits for new single-family and multifamily homes were up from a depressed March level. Sales of both existing and new homes in April and May were above the high levels recorded in recent quarters.
