The staff forecast prepared for this meeting once again suggested that the economic expansion would strengthen substantially as the year progressed. Accommodative financial conditions, recent additional fiscal stimulus, and robust gains in structural productivity would provide significant impetus to spending over the months ahead. Inventory overhangs had been substantially reduced, and business capital stocks likely had moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, improving sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected gradually to boost business investment spending. Given the ongoing slack in resource utilization, downward pressure on core price inflation was expected over the forecast period.
