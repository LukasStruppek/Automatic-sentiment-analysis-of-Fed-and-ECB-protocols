Private nonfarm payrolls changed little on balance in April and May after declines earlier in the year. Although employment in manufacturing continued to fall in May, hiring in temporary help services, which supplies many of its workers to manufacturing, picked up noticeably. Construction and financial services continued to add jobs. Unemployment edged up further in May, to 6.1 percent, and the number of both short-term job losers and longer-term unemployed increased as well. Initial claims for unemployment insurance remained high.
