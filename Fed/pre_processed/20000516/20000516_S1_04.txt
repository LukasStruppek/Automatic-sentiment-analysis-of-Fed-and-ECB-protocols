The Manager discussed some aspects of a suggested approach to the management of the System's portfolio over coming quarters prior to the Committee's review of an ongoing study relating to the conduct of open market operations in a period of substantial declines in outstanding Treasury debt. During that interim, the management of the System portfolio should try to satisfy a number of objectives: keeping the maturity of the portfolio from lengthening materially; meeting long-run reserve needs to the extent possible through outright purchases of Treasury securities without distorting the yield curve or impairing the liquidity of the market; and concentrating expansion of the System portfolio in "off-the-run" securities in the secondary market to help to maintain liquid markets in benchmark securities. It was important to announce a strategy to allow market participants to take the System's operations into account as they adapted to the declining Treasury debt levels. While no specific blueprint could be given at this point regarding future Desk operations, the members encouraged the Manager to discuss his plans with Treasury officials.
