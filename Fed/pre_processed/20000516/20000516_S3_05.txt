Business investment spending retained strong upward momentum, though it had exhibited an uneven growth pattern in recent quarters that importantly reflected Y2K effects. Looking ahead, further rapid growth was expected in spending for business equipment and software in light of likely ongoing efforts to hold down costs by substituting capital embodying advanced technology for scarce labor resources. Recent order trends and rising capacity utilization rates were consistent with this expectation. Expenditures on nonresidential structures and other construction generally had strengthened in recent months, and members expected them to be well maintained in part because of heavy spending on roads and other public projects by state and local governments.
