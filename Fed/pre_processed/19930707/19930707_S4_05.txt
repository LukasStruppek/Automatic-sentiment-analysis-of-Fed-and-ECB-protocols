[" At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one of the members indicated that they preferred or found acceptable a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that retained a bias toward possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with modest growth in the broader monetary aggregates over the third quarter. "]
