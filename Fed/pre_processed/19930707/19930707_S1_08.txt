[' Shipments of nondefense capital goods in May retraced only a portion of a sizable April decline. However, for the two months combined, shipments of such goods were above the average for the first quarter and apparently remained on an upward trend that began early in 1992. The upward trajectory for spending on machinery and on electrical and communications equipment seemed to have reflected improved cash flows for the business sector and a declining cost of capital, and incoming data suggested that outlays for business equipment would increase further over the months ahead. Nonresidential construction activity was unchanged over the first quarter but picked up slightly on balance over April and May. Office building rose over the two months, while construction of non-office commercial structures was little changed and industrial building activity was down sharply. ']
