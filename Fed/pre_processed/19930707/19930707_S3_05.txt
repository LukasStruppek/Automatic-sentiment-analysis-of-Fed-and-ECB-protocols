[' With regard to the outlook for business fixed investment, members reported that many firms were scaling back or putting on hold their capital spending plans pending a resolution of the business tax proposals under consideration in the Congress. Nonetheless, business spending for equipment still constituted a relatively robust sector of the economy, at least according to the data available to date. To a considerable extent, such spending reflected ongoing efforts to improve the quality of products and the efficiency of business operations while holding down the number of employees, and the members saw this trend as likely to continue. In general, other business capital spending had remained sluggish, although construction activity other than office building appeared to have picked up in parts of the country. The prospects for housing construction, though not ebullient, were viewed as more promising particularly in light of the declines in mortgage interest rates to relatively low levels. The improved financial position of many potential homebuyers also provided a basis for anticipating stronger housing markets. Despite these favorable factors, however, overall housing activity had improved only modestly in recent months as homebuyers tended to remain cautious, and at least in some areas housing developers continued to report that they were encountering difficulties in securing construction finance. On balance, housing construction seemed likely to provide some impetus to the expansion in coming quarters. ']
