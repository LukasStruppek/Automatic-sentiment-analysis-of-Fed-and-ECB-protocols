[' Mr. Angell dissented because he favored a prompt move to tighten policy. In his view, monetary policy was overly expansive at this point as evidenced by what he viewed as excessive liquidity in financial markets, the negative level of real short-term interest rates, and the disappointing lack of progress toward lower inflation this year. Given indications of worsening inflationary expectations, such as the substantial rise in the price of gold, as well as projections of an increase in inflation, a policy that led to a steady federal funds rate in fact implied a further easing of an already stimulative monetary policy. In these circumstances, a tightening of policy would not involve any significant risk to the expansion but would foster changes in financial conditions and the outlook for inflation that would be more consistent with renewed progress toward price stability in 1994 and later. Declining inflation around the world and a stronger trend of productivity growth in the United States, among other factors, were providing a favorable environment for further disinflation, but those developments needed to be supported and validated by appropriate monetary policy action.
