[' After contracting during the first quarter, M2 and M3 expanded appreciably over the second quarter. Most of this growth, which was especially pronounced in May, reflected strength in Ml and occurred despite continued heavy outflows to bond and equity funds. The May surge resulted in part from a strong pickup in mortgage refinancing activity and a reversal of the depressing effect in April of relatively damped individual nonwithheld tax payments on the seasonally adjusted level of liquid deposits. The growth of the broader aggregates moderated substantially in June, and by more than might have been suggested by the waning of these mortgage and tax influences. For the year through June, growth of both M2 and M3 was below the lower ends of the ranges for 1993 that the Committee had established in February. This sluggishness reflected ongoing changes in asset preferences and financing patterns rather than restrictive financial conditions. The velocity of M2 was estimated to have increased at a rate of about 4-1/2 percent over the first half of the year after a 4 percent rise in 1992. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded somewhat further through April. ']
