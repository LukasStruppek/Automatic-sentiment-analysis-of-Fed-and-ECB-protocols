[' In light of the limited reliance that the members felt they could place on the behavior of the current monetary aggregates, the Committee at this meeting reviewed the possible advantages of a newly constructed measure of money. This measure involved the addition of bond and stock mutual funds to M2 as currently defined. There were indications that the shares of such funds had become closer substitutes for M2, and large portfolio shifts into such funds seemed to account for much of the weakness in M2 and its uncertain relationship to income and the longer-run behavior of prices. After examining the properties of this measure and reviewing its past behavior in relation to key indicators of economic performance, the members concluded that it would not enhance the formulation or implementation of monetary policy, at least at this point. However, the members agreed that mutual funds flows should continue to be monitored for their effects on M2 and that the relevant data should be made available to outside analysts. ']
