[' The information reviewed at this meeting provided a mixed reading on the economy, but on balance the available data suggested that the expansion had picked up somewhat during the second quarter from the very slow pace of the first quarter. Employment statistics, while tending to soften in June, pointed to considerable strength for the second quarter as a whole, although recent spending indicators suggested a much more moderate expansion. Consumer and producer price inflation slowed substantially in May, but prices had risen at a faster rate over the first five months of the year than over the second half of 1992. ']
