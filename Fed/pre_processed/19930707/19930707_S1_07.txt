[' Real personal consumption expenditures edged higher in May after a sizable rebound in April from weather-related weakness. On balance, however, consumer spending had increased only slightly thus far this year. Outlays for new cars and light trucks advanced in May to their highest level since January 1990 and apparently remained near that elevated level in June. In addition, spending for non-energy services had increased substantially in recent months. By contrast, energy consumption had fallen from the especially high levels of late winter, and outlays for nondurable goods in May were still below their fourth-quarter level. Housing starts increased in April and May from a depressed first-quarter pace, with most of the rise attributable to starts of single-family dwellings. ']
