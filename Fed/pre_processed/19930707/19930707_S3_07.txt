[' Turning to the outlook for inflation, members commented that despite favorable readings recently, a wide range of price and wage data had suggested some acceleration in the rate of inflation during the early months of the year. To some extent, the indications of intensified inflation might have been the result of difficulties with seasonal adjustments or other temporary factors, but there were reports of some successful efforts by business firms to raise prices following the spurt in demand and the rise in capacity utilization toward the end of 1992. These price developments were disappointing and suggested to many members that the disinflationary trend might have been arrested, at least for now, though the economic fundamentals remained consistent with a resumption of some further downward movement in the rate of inflation. With regard to those fundamentals, many members saw significant, albeit diminished, slack in labor and product markets as likely to persist over the forecast horizon, given their current forecasts of moderate expansion in economic activity. Other favorable-factors in the inflation outlook included efforts by businesses to hold down costs and increase productivity by restructuring their operations and investing in new, more productive equipment. Unfortunately, these favorable elements in the underlying economic situation seemed at odds with the apparently widely held view by the public that inflation would not diminish and indeed was likely to increase and that in any event current inflation levels were tolerable. Such expectations and attitudes would tend to temper the gains against inflation, if any, over the forecast horizon by their effects on the pricing and wage behavior of business firms and employees and the reactions of consumers toward rising prices. This inflationary climate underscored the importance of credible government policies--monetary, fiscal, trade, and regulatory--that encouraged reduced inflation over time. ']
