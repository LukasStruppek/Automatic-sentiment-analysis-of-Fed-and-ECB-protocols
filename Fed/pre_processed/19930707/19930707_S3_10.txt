[" In light of this expectation, many of the members indicated their support of a proposal to lower the M2 and M3 ranges further for 1993 and on a tentative basis to retain the reduced ranges for 1994. It was emphasized during the discussion that the reductions were intended solely as technical adjustments to reflect expected increases in velocity and that the lower ranges did not imply any tightening of monetary policy. Rather, the reductions in the ranges would serve to align them with monetary growth rates that were more likely to be associated with a satisfactory economic performance. Indeed, M2 and M3 growth consistent with most members' forecasts might still leave the expansion of those aggregates near the lower ends of their reduced ranges for the year; at the same time, the probability of a surge in monetary growth to levels above the new ranges appeared remote. In this connection, some members commented that the uncertainties surrounding the behavior of M2 and M3 might well persist for some time. The value of these aggregates in guiding policy seemed to have diminished in 1992 and 1993, and the Committee needed to continue to rely on its evaluation of a broad array of other financial and economic developments in its assessment of an appropriate course for monetary policy. The members did not rule out the possibility that a more normal or predictable relationship between money and economic activity might be restored once the current process of balance sheet adjustments was completed, the yield curve flattened, and some stabilization in the intermediation function of depository institutions emerged. In the view of a few members, moreover, the lower range proposed for M2 might in fact be more consistent with the rate of monetary growth that would be needed over the long term to sustain price stability and satisfactory economic expansion, if the earlier relationships between broad money growth and economic performance were to reemerge.
