[' Industrial production increased in May at the relatively subdued rate recorded in March and April; for June, the limited data available suggested a modest decline in output. In May, assemblies of motor vehicles declined after holding steady over the two previous months. Among other manufactured goods, the production of business equipment, led by computers and industrial equipment, recorded another brisk advance whereas the output of non-auto consumer goods continued to expand sluggishly. Total utilization of industrial capacity was unchanged in May for a third straight month. ']
