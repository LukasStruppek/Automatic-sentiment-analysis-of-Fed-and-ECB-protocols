[" At this meeting, the Committee reviewed its practices with regard to the release of information to the public. This review was undertaken in response to media reports of the purported results of the May meeting before the Committee had made public any information about that meeting. In its discussion, the Committee reaffirmed its long-standing rules governing the confidentiality of FOMC information, including the schedule that calls for releasing the minutes of a Committee meeting, along with an explanation of the Committee's decisions, a few days after the next meeting. These rules are designed to safeguard the Committee's flexibility to make needed adjustments to policy and also to provide adequate time to prepare a full report of the context and rationale for its decisions. Committee members emphasized the potential for inadvertent leaks of information in the course of general conversations with representatives of the news media or others concerning the members' views about economic developments or monetary policy. The members agreed that particular care needed to be taken for some period before and after each of its meetings. "]
