[' In conformance with the usual practice at meetings when the Committee considers its longer-run objectives for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members provided individual projections of growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 1993 and 1994. In light of the experience in the first half of the year, forecasts of real growth in 1993 had been revised down somewhat since February, while projections of inflation had been raised. The central tendency of the forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP in 1993 was now 2-1/4 to 2-3/4 percent for the year as a whole; for 1994, these projections had a central tendency of 2-1/2 to 3-1/4 percent. With regard to the expansion of nominal GDP, the forecasts converged on growth rates of 5 to 5-3/4 percent for 1993 and 5 to 6-1/2 percent for 1994. Given the projections of a moderate uptrend in economic activity and expectations of some further gains in labor productivity, the forecasts incorporated only a small decline in unemployment to rates of around 6-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993 and only slightly lower by the fourth quarter of 1994. For the rate of inflation, as measured by the CPI, the projections had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/4 percent in 1993 and 3 to 3-1/2 percent in 1994, reflecting little change in both years from the rate of inflation experienced in 1992.
