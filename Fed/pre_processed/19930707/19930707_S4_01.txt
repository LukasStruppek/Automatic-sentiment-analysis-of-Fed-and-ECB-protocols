[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the period until the next meeting, most of the members indicated that they saw little or no reason to change monetary policy in either direction. The most recent information on the performance of the economy was mixed, and this together with questions about the course of fiscal policy contributed to considerable uncertainty about the outlook. Even so, the members felt that the evidence pointed on the whole to a sustained rate of economic expansion. The latest price statistics provided some encouragement that the apparent intensification of inflation in earlier months of the year might have abated. For now, therefore, nearly all the members saw the balance of factors bearing on the course of economic activity and the outlook for inflation as calling for an unchanged degree of pressure on reserve positions.
