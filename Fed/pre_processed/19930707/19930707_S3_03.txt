[' Members commented that the improved prospects for significant reductions in the federal deficit had played an important role in fostering the declines in longer-term interest rates that had occurred since the latter part of 1992: the lower rates were having positive effects on spending decisions in a number of interest-sensitive sectors of the economy as well as on balance sheets more generally. At the same time, the prospects for higher taxes--accentuated by uncertainties about their size and incidence--were widely reported to be inhibiting spending decisions by business firms and might also be adding to cautious consumer attitudes. Some of the anecdotal evidence suggested that uncertainties associated with the potential impact of the still unannounced proposals for health care reform were making many businesses especially cautious, notably in their hiring decisions. Adding to the effects of anticipated federal legislation were concerns in various parts of the country about further cuts in defense spending and the impact of additional reductions in state and local expenditures or of increases in state and local taxes. Some members observed that the fiscal policy legislation before the Congress appeared to have generated a perhaps exaggerated degree of concern, and passage of this legislation might have a generally favorable effect on business and consumer sentiment.
