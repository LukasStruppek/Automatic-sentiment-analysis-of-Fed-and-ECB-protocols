[" Several members indicated that while they could accept reductions in the 1993 ranges, they nonetheless preferred to retain the existing ranges. One reason given for this preference was that the prospective performance of the broad monetary aggregates in relation to developments in the economy was not sufficiently understood to warrant the specification of new ranges. Indeed, a change might be misinterpreted as implying more knowledge about velocity relationships than the Committee in fact possessed and could set up expectations that the Committee would put greater and, depending on emerging circumstances, perhaps undesirable emphasis on achieving monetary growth within the new ranges. Moreover, to the extent that some observers interpreted the ranges as the Committee's proxies for presumed nominal GDP objectives, an erroneous conclusion could be reached that the Committee had decided on a reduced target level of nominal GDP even though the Committee had not in fact framed its objectives in terms of GDP targets. On balance, while these members did not view this choice as a matter of great consequence in current circumstances, they concluded that it was marginally preferable to retain the ranges for this year, and if necessary, to accept and explain the reasons for a shortfall once the latter were more clearly established. The members who preferred to retain the current ranges agreed that there were plausible arguments on both sides of this issue and they could accept a proposal to reduce the ranges for both 1993 and 1994.
