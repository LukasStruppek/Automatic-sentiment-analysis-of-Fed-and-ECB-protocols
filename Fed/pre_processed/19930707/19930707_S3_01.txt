[" In the Committee's discussion, the members generally agreed that ongoing economic developments remained consistent with moderate but sustained growth in economic activity. No sector of the economy seemed poised at this juncture to provide strong impetus to the expansion, but a promising basis for further growth was seen in the much improved financial condition of many households and business firms. Lower long-term interest rates, which had contributed to the improvement in balance sheets, were likely as well to bolster housing and business capital spending more directly. While the expansion now appeared to be firmly established, a number of members cautioned that it was subject to some downside risks, notably those associated with the still uncertain outlook for government budget and other policies. The possibility of higher taxes, associated with the deficit reduction legislation currently under consideration in the Congress and with the forthcoming proposals for national health care reform, was widely reported to be damping spending. With regard to the outlook for inflation, the most recent data on prices offered some encouragement that the earlier upturn in key measures of inflation might prove to be temporary, especially in the context of still ample margins of unutilized labor and other production resources. Even so, given generally held expectations among the public that inflation was not likely to decline and might in fact trend higher, many members concluded that for now the disinflationary trend might have been arrested or, at least, that further progress toward price stability would be quite difficult to achieve over the next several quarters.
