[" The members had not had time to review the bill in detail or to consider fully all its implications. Nonetheless, their initial reaction was favorable in regard to the overall thrust of the bill's monetary policy provisions. These would make clear that price stability was the primary long-run objective of monetary policy and would restructure the monetary policy reporting requirements to permit the Congress to carry out its oversight responsibilities more effectively. Many members felt that in the context of seeking and maintaining price stability, monetary policy should have the flexibility to react to short-run fluctuations in output and employment, and they believed the bill would be improved if its intent in this regard were clarified. A few members expressed strong reservations about the part of the bill that would delete the employment objectives set forth in the Employment Act of 1946. "]
