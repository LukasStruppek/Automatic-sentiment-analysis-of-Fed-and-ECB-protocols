[" The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth in economic activity over the forecast horizon would be higher than the weak pace of the second quarter. The process of bringing inventories into better alignment with sales was well under way, and the favorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally in the debt and equity markets would tend to support moderate expansion of final sales. Consumer spending was expected to grow at a pace generally in line with incomes; the favorable effects on spending of higher prices for financial assets held by households would be offset to a degree in this forecast by less robust labor market conditions and the difficulties that growing numbers of households would encounter in servicing their enlarged debts. Homebuilding was expected to be somewhat stronger in response to the earlier decline in mortgage rates and the related improvement in housing affordability. In anticipation of slower growth of sales and profits, business investment in new equipment and structures was projected to slow from the very rapid pace of the past few years, although the lower cost of capital and the ready availability of financing would help to sustain appreciable expansion in such investment. Export growth would pick up in response to some expected strengthening in the economies of major trading partners. A great deal of uncertainty surrounded the fiscal outlook, but the staff continued to build a considerable degree of fiscal restraint into its forecast. In the staff's judgment, the prospects for some further easing of pressures on labor and other resources suggested that price inflation likely would not deviate significantly from recent trends. "]
