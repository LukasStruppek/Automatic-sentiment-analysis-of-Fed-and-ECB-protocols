[' In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined over the intermeeting period. The dollar moved higher over most of the period, partly in response to monetary easing actions in Germany, which were quickly followed by similar steps in other European countries, and in Japan. The policy easing in Japan was accompanied, inter alia, by statements by U.S. and Japanese officials that they would welcome a weaker yen. The dollar reversed course late in the intermeeting period, however, following the announcement of a new Japanese fiscal package and emerging uncertainties about the prospects for European monetary union. On balance over the period, the dollar moved lower against most European currencies while appreciating significantly further against the yen. ']
