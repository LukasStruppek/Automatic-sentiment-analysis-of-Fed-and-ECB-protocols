[' Business inventory accumulation slowed in June and July from a very rapid rate earlier in the year: stockpiling continued at a brisk pace in manufacturing and wholesale trade, but retail stocks were drawn down. In manufacturing, stocks increased in July at about the average rate seen in the second quarter; however, the stocks-to-shipments ratio rose somewhat, reflecting in part a reduction in shipments that might have been exaggerated by difficulties of seasonal adjustment. Wholesale inventories also advanced at about the second-quarter pace, and the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector moved up to the upper end of its range for recent years. At the retail level, reduced stocks at automotive dealers accounted for much of the July decline in inventories; the ratio of inventories to sales edged lower but remained near the middle of the range for recent years.
