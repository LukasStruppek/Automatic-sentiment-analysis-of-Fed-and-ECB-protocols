[' Shipments of nondefense capital goods fell appreciably in July after having risen rapidly over the first half of the year, and sales of heavy trucks also were down substantially.

Nonresidential construction posted another sizable gain in July. Outlays for office, industrial, and institutional structures registered healthy increases, but other commercial building activity was unchanged. ']
