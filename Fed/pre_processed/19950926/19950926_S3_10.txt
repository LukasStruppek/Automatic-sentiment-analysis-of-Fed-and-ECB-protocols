[' One uncertainty bearing on the outlook for inflation was the extent to which potentially greater pressures on labor costs would be translated into higher prices. Increases in labor expenses had been held down by markedly reduced advances in the costs of benefits, notably medical benefits. The economies from the latter source might well lessen over coming quarters as the most easily implemented reductions in the costs of providing medical care were achieved. Moreover, the rise in worker compensation had been unusually restrained in recent years in relation to the strong demand for workers, evidently reflecting the effects of worker concerns about job security in a period of business restructurings and downsizings, but continued strength in the demand for labor might be expected to induce more rapid increases in labor compensation over time. Some members commented, however, that the underlying factors affecting employment costs were not likely to change greatly over the forecast period. In addition, the prospect that intense competitive pressures would persist in many markets under projected economic conditions suggested that business firms would continue to find it very difficult to pass on rising costs through higher prices. It also was possible that the rates of capacity utilization and employment associated with a steady rate of inflation had changed in the direction of providing the economy greater leeway to operate at a somewhat higher level without generating more inflation.
