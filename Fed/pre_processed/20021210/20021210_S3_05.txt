Housing activity had continued to display solid overall strength, though members mentioned weakness in multifamily construction and the high-end sector of the single-family market. Historically low mortgage interest rates along with rising incomes evidently were continuing to sustain the robust demand for housing. In addition, large extractions of equity from appreciated housing values continued to foster not only added consumer spending but also improvement in the financial condition of many households through debt consolidation and repayments and reduced interest charges. However, there were anecdotal indications of decreasing refinancing activity in the housing sector.
