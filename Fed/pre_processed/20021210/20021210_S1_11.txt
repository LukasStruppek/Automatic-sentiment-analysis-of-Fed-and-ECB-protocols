Core consumer price inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) and the chain-weighted personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, continued to trend lower in October. Inflation, in terms of both indexes, was down over the last twelve months when compared with the previous twelve-month period. At the producer level, core price inflation for finished goods over the twelve months ended in October was at a very low rate. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased moderately in November, and the growth in those earnings over the last twelve months fell considerably, evidently reflecting the slack in labor markets.
