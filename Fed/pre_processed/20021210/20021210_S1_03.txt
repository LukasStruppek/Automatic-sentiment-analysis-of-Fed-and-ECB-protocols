The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth had been sluggish on balance since midsummer. Housing demand remained strong, but business fixed investment was still in the doldrums and consumer spending had flagged in late summer before apparently picking up somewhat in the autumn. Payroll employment had changed little since midyear, and industrial production still seemed to be on a downward trend. Most price indexes continued to indicate that inflation had declined over the past year.
