The outcome of the recent Congressional elections had fostered expectations that fiscal policy might be more expansive than previously anticipated, although the size, timing, and composition of federal budget initiatives were subject to substantial uncertainty. Members commented that added fiscal stimulus might prove to be a useful complement to an accommodative monetary policy in the period immediately ahead when economic activity was likely to remain below the economy's potential. In this regard, some observed that additional stimulus on the federal level would be an offset to measures that were being taken by numerous state and local governments to address severe budget deficits. At the same time, a number of members expressed the hope that new fiscal legislation would not endanger the prospects for federal budget discipline over the longer run, given the desirability of supporting national saving and capital accumulation.
