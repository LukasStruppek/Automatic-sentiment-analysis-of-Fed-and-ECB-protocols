At its meeting on November 6, 2002, the Committee adopted a directive that called for lowering the target for the intended federal funds rate by 50 basis points, to 1-1/4 percent. The Committee also agreed that, in light of the decision to ease, it would be appropriate to indicate in the press release that the risks were balanced for the foreseeable future. Market participants had expected a 25 basis point cut and retention of a statement of risks toward weakness. The unexpectedly large reduction in the federal funds rate target led to an initial decline in Treasury coupon yields. That drop was reversed when market participants apparently focused on the shift to balanced risks and concluded that the odds of pronounced economic weakness had fallen. The subsequent release of better-than-expected economic data and earnings news provided reassurance to investors, though more mixed economic reports became available late in the intermeeting period. Over the period as a whole, major equity indexes registered mixed changes, and yields on longer-term Treasury bonds increased somewhat. In private debt markets, rates on investment-grade debt issues eased a little, and those on speculative-grade bonds fell considerably more.
