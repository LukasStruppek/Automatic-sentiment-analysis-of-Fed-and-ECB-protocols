The contraction in residential construction continued into early 2008. Single-family housing starts fell in both January and February. After having dropped especially sharply in December, multifamily housing starts rebounded somewhat in the first two months of the year. New home sales declined again in January, thereby pushing inventories of unsold homes to even higher levels relative to sales. Sales of existing homes held roughly steady in January, and the index of pending sales agreements in that month was consistent with flat sales in February and March. Overall, demand for housing continued to be restrained by tight financing conditions for jumbo and nonprime mortgages.
