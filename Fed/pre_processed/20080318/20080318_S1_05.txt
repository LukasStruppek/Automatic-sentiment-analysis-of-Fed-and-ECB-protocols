Real consumer spending appeared to have stalled in recent months. Real outlays for nondurable and durable consumer goods, including automobiles, were estimated to have declined, on average, in January and February. Real disposable personal income was unchanged in the fourth quarter, held down by higher food and energy prices, and moved up only slightly in January. Further declines in house prices led to a noticeable decrease in the ratio of household wealth to disposable income in the fourth quarter. The downturn in equity prices since December further reduced household wealth in the first quarter. Readings on consumer sentiment dropped sharply in February from already low levels, and the Reuters/University of Michigan survey remained at a depressed level in early March.
