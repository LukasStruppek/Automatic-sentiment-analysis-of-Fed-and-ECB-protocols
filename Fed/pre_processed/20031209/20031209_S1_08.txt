The data on orders for, and shipments of, nondefense capital goods through October suggested continued momentum in spending on equipment and software, which grew in the third quarter at the fastest pace since 1998. Robust gains in spending were posted in the third quarter in all the major categories except aircraft. The gains were associated with recent increases in business output and corporate cash flow and with a decline this year in the user cost of capital. Shipments of high-tech equipment climbed further in October, while shipments in other nondefense sectors excluding aircraft edged down. New orders of nondefense equipment excluding aircraft in October continued the upward trend in place since the beginning of the year and were consistent with ongoing gains in equipment spending. Outlays for the construction of private-sector nonresidential buildings fell a bit in October, but the extended contraction in spending on nonresidential construction appeared to be ending. Nominal spending on office space edged up in September and October, while outlays for the construction of other commercial buildings moved lower. Expenditures on institutional buildings changed little in recent months.
