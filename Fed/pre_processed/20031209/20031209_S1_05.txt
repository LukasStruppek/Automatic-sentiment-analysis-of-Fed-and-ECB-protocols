Industrial production grew solidly in the third quarter, and the momentum continued in October apart from the production of motor vehicles and parts, which fell back from an elevated third-quarter level. High-tech output accelerated in the third quarter to the fastest pace since the middle of 2000, and production gains continued at a rapid pace in October. Outside the manufacturing sector, unseasonably warm weather contributed to an increase in output at utilities in October, while mining production declined a bit, largely reflecting a decrease in the production of crude oil. Capacity utilization edged up in October but remained well below its longer-term average.
