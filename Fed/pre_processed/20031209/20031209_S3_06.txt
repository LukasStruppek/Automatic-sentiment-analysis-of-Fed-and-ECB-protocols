Members anticipated that growth in federal government spending, which had been boosted in recent quarters by a buildup in defense outlays, would slow going forward, while budget pressures would continue to limit increases in state and local spending. Although fiscal policy more generally would probably continue to strengthen aggregate demand next year, this effect was expected to diminish somewhat even though very large deficits were likely to persist. Over a longer horizon, some members expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of such deficits on financial markets and the economy.
