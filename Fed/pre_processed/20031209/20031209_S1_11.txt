Core consumer price inflation remained subdued in October, although it was up from even lower levels in the first part of the year, when it was depressed by transitory factors. Over the twelve months ending in October, core consumer prices rose only slightly and noticeably less than in the previous twelve-month period. Total twelve-month consumer inflation was unchanged over the period owing to accelerations in food and energy prices. Producer prices for both core and total finished goods posted unusually large increases in October, reflecting in part a sizable advance in the prices of motor vehicles. Twelve-month core producer price inflation, however, was on balance unchanged over the year ending October, although the twelve-month change in overall producer prices stood well above its year-earlier level owing to a jump in food and energy price inflation. With regard to labor costs, the average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose slightly in the twelve months ending in November; the increase was a bit below that in the previous twelve months. By contrast, the increase in the employment cost index for hourly compensation in private industry for the twelve months ending in September was a bit higher than a year earlier, reflecting a pickup in benefit costs.
