Consumer spending slipped a little on balance in September and October after soaring in July and August. Much of the recent decline was the result of a pullback in purchases of motor vehicles; elsewhere, expenditures were about unchanged in September and rose modestly in October. Spending was supported by the upturn in employment, continued impetus from the recently enacted tax cuts, improved confidence, and a level of wealth that was considerably above that of earlier in the year.
