The Committee's decision at the October meeting to leave its target for the federal funds rate unchanged had been widely anticipated, and rates on near-dated federal funds futures were virtually unchanged. However, the Committee's retention of both an unchanged risk assessment and its indication that policy could remain accommodative for a considerable period, which market participants apparently had seen as less certain outcomes, precipitated a brief rally in Treasury markets. Over the intermeeting period as a whole, intermediate- and longer-term Treasury yields were basically unchanged. Upward movements in response to data releases showing an economy building momentum were offset by the market response to several statements by policymakers reiterating that policy could remain accommodative and to the November employment report, which included a smaller gain in private nonfarm payrolls than market participants had expected. Yields on investment-grade corporate securities were also essentially unchanged, while yields on speculative-grade securities declined, continuing the narrowing of their risk spreads. Major equity indexes were up moderately over the intermeeting period.
