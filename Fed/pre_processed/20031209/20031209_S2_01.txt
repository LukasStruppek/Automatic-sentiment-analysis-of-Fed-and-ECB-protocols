The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that the economic expansion was likely to be sufficiently robust to reduce economic slack substantially in coming quarters. Accommodative financial conditions, fiscal stimulus, and substantial gains in structural productivity would continue to provide significant impetus to business and consumer spending over the months ahead. In addition, businesses appeared to be shedding some of the caution that had characterized their behavior for the previous three years. As a consequence, with sales, profits, and stock prices higher, the liquidation of inventories appeared to be ending, and the strengthening of capital investment and pickup in hiring already evident in the data were projected to continue. Even though the unemployment rate was projected to decline over coming quarters, some slight downward pressure on core consumer price inflation was anticipated in the forecast, given ongoing slack in resource utilization.
