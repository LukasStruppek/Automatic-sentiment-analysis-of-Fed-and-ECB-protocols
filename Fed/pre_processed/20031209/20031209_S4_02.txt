In their discussion of the announcement to be issued shortly after this meeting, the members agreed that in addition to updating to reflect recent economic developments, some rewording was needed to reflect their evolving assessment of the risks to the economy. In light of the recent acceleration in economic activity and their expectations of relatively robust growth ahead, the members believed that the clearest way to convey their changed assessment was to note that the risks of substantial disinflation had diminished appreciably. While a number of members saw some slight further disinflation as the most plausible outcome, no one expected a material change in inflation. All could agree that the risks of further disinflation were substantially reduced and close to balance for overall inflation. In the circumstances, most members endorsed a proposal to delete as no longer necessary the previous summary statement relating to the risks to growth and inflation taken together.
