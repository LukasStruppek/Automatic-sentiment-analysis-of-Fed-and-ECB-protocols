In their comments about recent developments around the nation, members reported improving economic conditions in virtually all regions, with strength in household spending increasingly augmented by gains in business outlays. Consumer spending remained firm, and residential construction continued at a high level. Committee members' business contacts generally expressed increasing confidence that the expansion would be sustained, and they anticipated further increases in investment outlays and employment going forward. Even in manufacturing, which had lagged the recovery in the rest of the economy until recently, output was rising in many subsectors and employment displayed signs of stabilizing. Some members reported an easing of downward pressures on prices in selected industries, but anecdotal reports suggested that competition, including especially competition from foreign producers, continued to constrain pricing.
