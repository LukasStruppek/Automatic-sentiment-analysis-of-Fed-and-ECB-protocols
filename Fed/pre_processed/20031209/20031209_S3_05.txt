Household spending had remained solid even as the effects of tax refunds and mortgage refinancing, which had boosted spending substantially in the summer, waned. While consumption spending had slowed earlier in the fall, retail contacts suggested some strengthening more recently and reported that holiday sales appeared to be running somewhat above last year's pace. Looking forward, members anticipated that consumer spending would be supported by further gains in employment as well as by substantial tax refunds in the first half of next year. And with the expansion picking up momentum, the risk of a slowdown in such spending clearly seemed to have diminished. Some members pointed, however, to signs of increased financial stress that could limit the ability of many households to hold spending at recent levels, especially if incomes did not rise at a robust pace in line with current forecasts. In the housing sector, activity remained elevated despite some increase in mortgage rates since early summer.
