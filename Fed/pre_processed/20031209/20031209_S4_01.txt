In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members favored an unchanged policy that continued to incorporate a target of 1 percent for the federal funds rate. The data and anecdotal evidence becoming available since the last meeting had made the members more confident that robust growth in economic activity would persist. Nonetheless, they felt that the currently accommodative policy stance remained appropriate in a period characterized by very low inflation, wide margins of unused labor and other resources, and still considerable uncertainty about the speed with which those margins would be worked down. In these circumstances, inflationary pressures appeared likely to remain subdued well into the future. To be sure, the Committee needed to remain attentive to any indications of rising inflation pressures and to be prepared to adjust its policy stance if emerging economic conditions warranted such a move. At some point, a move in the direction of a less accommodative and more neutral policy posture might well be necessary should the apparently vigorous expansion continue and over time promote fuller utilization of resources. For the near term, however, members saw substantial benefit in maintaining an unchanged policy stance and considerable risk in taking preemptive action that could prove to be unneeded against potential inflation, with associated costs to economic performance.
