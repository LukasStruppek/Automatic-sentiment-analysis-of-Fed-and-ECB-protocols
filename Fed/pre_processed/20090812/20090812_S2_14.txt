The level of private domestic nonfinancial sector debt apparently declined again in the second quarter, as household debt was estimated to have dropped and nonfinancial business debt appeared to have been essentially unchanged. Gross issuance of speculative- and investment-grade bonds by nonfinancial corporations slowed in July from its outsized second-quarter pace. Issuance of institutional loans in the syndicated leveraged loan market reportedly remained extremely weak in July, while bank loans and commercial paper continued to run off, leaving net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations at around zero. In contrast, the federal government issued debt at a rapid clip, and state and local government debt was estimated to have expanded moderately.
