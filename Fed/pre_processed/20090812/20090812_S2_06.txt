Real investment in E&S continued to contract in the second quarter; however, the estimated rate of decline was substantially smaller than in the previous two quarters. Business outlays on motor vehicles leveled off in the second quarter after an extended period of steep declines. Real spending in the high-tech sector declined, although real outlays for computing equipment posted their first gain in a year. Outside of high-tech and transportation, real spending on equipment dropped again in the second quarter but at a slower pace than in the previous quarter. Although the fundamental determinants of investment in E&S remained weak, conditions appeared less unfavorable, on balance, than earlier in the year. In particular, the decline in business output was less pronounced in the second quarter than in prior quarters, and estimates of the user cost of capital fell back somewhat in the second quarter after spiking last year. Other forward-looking indicators generally improved, but they remained at levels consistent with a weak outlook for E&S investment. Corporate bond spreads over Treasury securities continued to ease, and monthly surveys of business conditions and sentiment generally were less downbeat than earlier in the year. In addition, the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported that the net percentage of banks that had tightened standards and terms on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans receded somewhat, although the July National Federation of Independent Business survey showed that the share of small businesses reporting increased difficulty in obtaining credit remained high. Conditions in the nonresidential construction sector generally remained quite poor, with spending in most major categories staying on a downward trajectory through June. Vacancy rates continued to rise, property prices fell further, and, as indicated by the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, financing for nonresidential construction projects became even tighter.
