Labor market conditions remained of particular concern to meeting participants. Though recent data indicated that the pace at which employment was declining had slowed appreciably, job losses remained sizable. Moreover, long-term unemployment and permanent separations continued to rise, suggesting possible problems of skill loss and a need for labor reallocation that could slow recovery in employment as the economy begins to expand. The unusually large fraction of those who were working part time for economic reasons and the unusually low level of the average workweek, combined with indications from business contacts that firms would resist hiring as sales and production turn up, also pointed to a period of modest job gains and thus a slow decline in the unemployment rate. Wages and benefits continued to decelerate, reflecting--in the judgment of many participants--substantial slack in labor markets. Several participants noted that the deceleration in labor costs should eventually support a pickup in hiring. Recently, however, it contributed to weakness in household incomes.
