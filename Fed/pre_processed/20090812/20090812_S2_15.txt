Commercial bank credit contracted further in June and July. All major loan categories declined, apparently reflecting the combined effects of weaker demand for most types of loans, some substitution from bank loans to other funding sources, and an ongoing tightening of lending standards and terms. Commercial and industrial lending dropped steeply amid subdued origination activity and broad-based paydowns of outstanding loans. In the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, respondents indicated that the most important reasons for the decline in C&I loans in 2009 were weaker demand from creditworthy borrowers and the deterioration in credit quality that had reduced the number of firms that respondents viewed as creditworthy. The contraction in commercial real estate (CRE) lending accelerated. Large fractions of respondents to the July survey again noted that they had tightened standards and that the demand for CRE loans had weakened further.
