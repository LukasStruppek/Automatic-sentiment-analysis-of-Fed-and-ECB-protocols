Recent indicators of economic activity in the advanced foreign economies suggested that the pace of contraction in those countries moderated further. Purchasing managers indexes continued to rebound but did not yet point to expansion for all countries. Industrial production, while remaining well below pre-crisis levels, moved up strongly in Japan and edged up in the euro area and in the United Kingdom. Indicators of economic sentiment also improved. However, labor market conditions continued to deteriorate, and credit standards remained generally tight. In emerging market economies, recent data showed that economic activity surged across emerging Asia in the second quarter. Real GDP rebounded sharply in China and South Korea, and the preliminary estimate in Singapore indicated a substantial increase. In China, policy stimulus lifted activity and thus helped boost China's imports, primarily from other countries in Asia. Indicators for these other countries also pointed to a strong rebound in the second quarter. Activity remained depressed in Mexico, partly reflecting the adverse effect of a swine flu outbreak. In contrast, activity in Brazil appeared to have begun to recover.
