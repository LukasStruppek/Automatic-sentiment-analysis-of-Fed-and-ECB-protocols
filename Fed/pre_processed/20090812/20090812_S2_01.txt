 The information reviewed at the August 11-12 meeting suggested that overall economic activity was stabilizing after a contraction in real gross domestic product (GDP) during 2008 and early 2009 that the Bureau of Economic Analysis recently reported to have been greater than it had previously estimated Employment continued to move lower through July, but the pace of job losses had slowed noticeably in recent months A sizable pickup in motor vehicle production appeared to be under way Housing activity apparently was beginning to turn up Consumer spending dropped only a little further in the first half of this year, on balance, after falling sharply in the second half of last year The decline in equipment and software (E&S) investment seemed to be moderating, although the incoming data did not point to an imminent recovery The sharp cuts in production this year reduced inventory stocks significantly, though they remained high relative to the level of sales A jump in gasoline prices pushed up overall consumer price inflation in June, but core consumer price inflation remained relatively stable in recent months
