Personal consumption expenditures are estimated to have rebounded in October, following the large September decline, and were slightly above the third-quarter average. Purchases of motor vehicles surged in response to aggressive zero-rate financing packages offered by automakers, while spending on other goods made a partial recovery from the September drop. Outlays on consumer services strengthened in October, but they remained below their third-quarter average.
