M2 growth in November was robust though well below the average pace of the two previous months. Liquid deposits continued to increase rapidly, reflecting the sharp drop in market interest rates this year, but inflows to retail money funds slowed as the economic outlook improved and the equity markets rallied. M3 expansion remained at a very high rate in November, bolstered by the growth of M2 and heavy bank acquisitions of nondeposit liabilities. The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors grew at a moderate pace on balance through October.
