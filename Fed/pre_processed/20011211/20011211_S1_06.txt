Industrial production fell sharply further in October, and the cuts continued to be spread widely across groups and industries, reflecting weak demand for business equipment, efforts by firms to pare inventories, and foreign competition. Motor vehicle assemblies slowed for a third straight month from the relatively high levels attained in the spring and early summer, and the output of high-technology goods remained on a steep downward trajectory, though a few positive signs had begun to emerge in the semiconductor and computer industries. The rate of utilization of total manufacturing capacity contracted further in October and was at a level substantially below the trough reached in the 1990-91 recession.
