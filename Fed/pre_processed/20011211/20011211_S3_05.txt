The liquidation of business inventories appeared to have accelerated in the current quarter, fostered to an important extent by very large declines in stocks of motor vehicles. Inventories now seemed to be approaching levels where firms would start to reduce their rate of liquidation early next year and perhaps turn to inventory accumulation as the year ahead progressed, giving a boost to production and incomes. Anecdotal reports provided some support for such an outlook, including widespread indications that retail inventories were already at quite lean levels, even outside the motor vehicle sector. At the same time, recent survey results pointed to less discomfort with current inventory levels though some further inventory correction was anticipated in manufacturing.
