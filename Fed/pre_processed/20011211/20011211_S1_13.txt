At its meeting on November 6, 2001, the Committee adopted a directive that called for implementing conditions in reserve markets consistent with a decrease of 50 basis points in the intended level of the federal funds rate, to about 2 percent. The members referred to the heightened degree of uncertainty and risk aversion following the terrorist attacks that was having a significant effect on business and household spending, and they noted that the substantial easing of monetary policy that had been put in place this year had not shown through fully to long-term interest rates, equity prices, bank lending rates, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar. In these circumstances, with price inflation relatively low and pressures on prices and resources likely to ebb further, the members concluded that further monetary stimulus would provide some added insurance against a more extended contraction of the economy at little risk of a pickup in inflation. The members also believed that the balance of risks remained weighted toward conditions that could generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.
