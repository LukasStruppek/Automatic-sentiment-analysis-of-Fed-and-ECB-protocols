In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all but one member indicated their support of a proposal to ease reserve conditions slightly further, consistent with a 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate to a level of 1-3/4 percent. While there were signs that the weakness in aggregate demand might be abating, those signs were still quite limited and tentative. For now, contractionary forces continued to depress overall economic activity, and subpar economic performance seemed likely to persist, at least for a time. Moreover, a number of members saw substantial risks that economic activity could even fall short of a projection of stabilization in the near term and moderate recovery later next year. In these circumstances, the consequences of inactivity at this meeting could turn out to be considerable, and several members viewed an easing action as a measure of insurance against the potential for greater or more prolonged economic weakness than they currently anticipated. If a modest easing action taken today turned out to be unneeded, the Committee would have ample opportunity to reverse its action without incurring any real risk of allowing inflationary pressures to gather momentum, given the projected degree of slack in resource use and the current absence of significant inflationary pressures. The risk that a policy reversal, should it prove to be needed in the near term, would foster significant market unsettlement seemed limited in light of widespread expectations of some further easing at this meeting to be followed by a policy turnaround next year.
