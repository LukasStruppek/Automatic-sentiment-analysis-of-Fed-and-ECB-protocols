Mr. Hoenig dissented because he preferred to leave the federal funds rate unchanged. He judged that a 2 percent federal funds rate was already quite stimulative and that a more stimulative policy was not needed. Following the rapid and aggressive policy actions already taken, it would be prudent to give the current policy more time to work through the economy. It was also his position that reducing the federal funds rate at this meeting could increase interest rate volatility by creating an expectation of a faster or a more aggressive reversal of policy.
