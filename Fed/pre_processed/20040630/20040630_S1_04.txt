The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy continued to expand at a solid pace during the second quarter. Although growth in consumer spending appeared to have slowed somewhat, the demand for housing increased from its robust first-quarter pace. Business fixed investment, boosted by surging outlays on equipment and software, also grew rapidly. The labor market improved further during the quarter, with large gains in employment registered in April and May. Core consumer price inflation picked up, reflecting in part the pass-through of substantial advances in energy prices and non-energy import prices.
