Activity in the housing market increased in April and May despite a considerable rise in mortgage interest rates. Single-family housing starts edged above their rapid first-quarter pace, and sales of both new and existing homes reached record levels in May. In the volatile multifamily sector, housing starts fell somewhat in May, but, more generally, construction activity in this sector had been surprisingly resilient in light of the high vacancy rate for such units.
