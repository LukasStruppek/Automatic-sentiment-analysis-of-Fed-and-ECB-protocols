M2 continued to expand rapidly in May. The upswing in M2 growth since late winter stemmed in part from the temporary effects of mortgage refinancing, which boosted liquid deposits over this period, though M2 was also buoyed by strong gains in nominal income. In recent months, a rebound in currency growth and reduced portfolio shifts by households from monetary assets to equities and bonds also supported the expansion of M2. The growth of M2 slowed appreciably during the first half of June. Commercial bank credit decelerated in May, reflecting a contraction in bank holdings of securities and a slowdown in the growth of loans. The slowing in loan growth was concentrated mainly in real estate credits and was due partly to heavy securitizations.
