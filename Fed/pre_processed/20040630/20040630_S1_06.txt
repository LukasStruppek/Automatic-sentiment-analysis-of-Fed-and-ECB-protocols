Industrial production accelerated in April and May after a sizable advance in the first quarter. Output at utilities surged in the latter month, reflecting weather-related factors, and factory output excluding motor vehicles, buoyed by strong gains in both high-tech manufacturing industries and in most non-high-tech industries, expanded sharply in both months. In contrast, the production of motor vehicles declined as automakers trimmed outsized inventory positions. Capacity utilization moved higher but stayed below its long-run average.
