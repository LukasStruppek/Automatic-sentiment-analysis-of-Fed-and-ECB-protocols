The labor market rebounded strongly in recent months. Private nonfarm payrolls grew rapidly in April and May, with hiring widespread across industries. The manufacturing sector appeared to be on a more solid footing, as manufacturers added jobs in each of the past four months after more than three years of declines. Aggregate hours moved up in both April and May, bringing the level of hours substantially above its trough of last summer. Despite the recent strength in hiring, the unemployment rate changed little in recent months, and the labor force participation rate remained low.
