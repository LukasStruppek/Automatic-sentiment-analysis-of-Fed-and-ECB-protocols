Consumer price inflation turned up this year from the very low rates registered in 2003, both for overall measures and for those that exclude food and energy. Overall consumer prices rose more quickly than core prices, reflecting the direct contributions of substantial increases in prices of food and energy. But the step-up in core inflation was also due in part to the pass-through of higher energy and import costs into core consumer prices. Some survey measures of short-term inflation expectations moved higher in recent months, but longer-term expectations remained reasonably well contained. Commodity prices escalated sharply during the early months of 2004, but indexes of spot prices for industrial materials and for wholesale gasoline retreated appreciably in recent weeks. Meanwhile, labor costs appeared to have turned up in the first half of the year. Hourly compensation in private industry rose in the first quarter at the same rate as in 2003, but with the pace of productivity advance moderating, unit labor costs moved higher. In April and May, increases in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls exceeded the monthly gains registered in the first quarter and were well above the increases in the fourth quarter of 2003.
