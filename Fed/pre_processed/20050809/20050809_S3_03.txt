Participants indicated that business investment had been evolving roughly in line with their expectations. Strong fundamentals, including low interest rates, wide profit margins, and a high level of liquid assets, were seen as supporting expenditures on software and equipment going forward.

Inventories now seemed to be coming in line with the trend in final demand and were anticipated to expand along with sales later this year.
