The information received at this meeting suggested that final demand had expanded at a solid pace in the second quarter, led by a surge in net exports and another robust gain in residential investment, while business investment and consumer spending rose at moderate rates. The labor market continued to improve gradually in June and July. Core CPI and PCE prices decelerated in recent months, after notable increases earlier in the year. Crude oil prices continued to rise, reaching record levels in nominal terms over the intermeeting period.
