[" Other members indicated that they preferred a less forceful policy move at this point, one that would be consistent with the 1/2 percentage point increase in the discount rate that had been proposed by several Federal Reserve Banks. In their view, substantial further restraint could be expected from the combined effects of the policy tightening actions implemented earlier this year and the inevitable waning of the stimulative effects of policy actions taken in previous years. While the need for further monetary restraint could not be ruled out, a more limited policy move at this point could reasonably be expected in this view to accomplish the greater part or all of the Committee's anti-inflationary objectives over time and would minimize the risk of setting policy on an overly restrictive course with undesired consequences for the business expansion later. Moreover, a cautious approach could lessen the risk that the Committee's policy intentions would be misinterpreted, with some resulting damage to consumer and business confidence and dislocation in financial markets. Despite their reservations, these members indicated that they could accept the degree of restraint preferred by the majority because of the quite small difference in the effects of the alternative moves on the economy over time.
