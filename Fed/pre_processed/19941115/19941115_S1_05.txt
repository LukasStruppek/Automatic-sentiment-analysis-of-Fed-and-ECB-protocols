[' Nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably further in October, with job gains widespread by industry. In the service-producing sector, retail trade posted a particularly large advance while health and business services continued to record moderate increases. Manufacturing employment was up in October after having been unchanged in September; the rise was related partly to continued job growth in automobile-and construction-related industries, but payrolls also expanded in a number of other industries, including textiles, paper, rubber, and plastics. Construction hiring slowed after a large rise in September. Employment, as measured by the household survey, increased by more than the labor force in October, and the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 5.8 percent. ']
