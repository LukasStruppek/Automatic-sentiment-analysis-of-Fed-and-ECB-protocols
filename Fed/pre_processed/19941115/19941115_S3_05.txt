[' With regard to the outlook for housing, members reported that conditions were somewhat uneven across the country but that for the nation as a whole rising mortgage rates had had surprisingly little effect thus far on this typically interest-sensitive sector of the economy.

Overall construction activity was likely to be supported to some extent, however, by further gradual gains in nonresidential construction, notably commercial and industrial structures, and perhaps some continuing strength in multifamily housing.
