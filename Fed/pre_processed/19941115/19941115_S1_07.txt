[' Consumer confidence remained at a high level, and retail sales continued to rise rapidly in October. Automotive dealers reported a large increase in sales, but strength also was evident elsewhere: Furniture and appliance stores posted another appreciable gain; apparel outlets registered a brisk rise; and spending at food and general merchandise stores grew moderately. Housing starts rose appreciably in September, reaching their highest level of the year. Sales of new and existing homes were stronger in September, despite the higher interest rates on both fixed-and adjustable-rate mortgages that had prevailed since earlier in the year. ']
