[" At its meeting on September 27, 1994, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions but included a bias toward possible firming during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and M3 over the balance of the year. "]
