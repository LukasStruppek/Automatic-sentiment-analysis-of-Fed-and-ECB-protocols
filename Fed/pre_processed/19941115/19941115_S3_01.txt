[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented on widespread statistical and anecdotal indications of considerably greater strength in the business expansion than they had anticipated earlier, with numerous industries now operating at or beyond historic, long-run capacity levels. They saw few signs that growth in aggregate demand might be moderating toward a more sustainable pace; nonetheless, they continued to view some slowing as a reasonable expectation as the monetary policy tightening actions implemented earlier exerted their lagged effects on interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. At this point, increases in prices of final goods and services and in wages generally did not appear to be trending higher, but the members were concerned that inflation would worsen as the effects of continuing strong demand, rising production costs, and higher import prices increasingly were felt in an environment where the utilization of labor and other producer resources was already at, if not above, sustainable full employment levels.
