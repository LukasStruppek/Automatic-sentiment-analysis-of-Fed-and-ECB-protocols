[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed in August, but for July and August combined the deficit was substantially larger than its second-quarter average. The value of exports of goods and services rebounded in August, with increases spread widely among automotive products, aircraft, agricultural products, machinery, and consumer goods. The value of imports also increased in August, but by a lesser amount than that of exports; much of the rise reflected greater imports of automotive vehicles from Canada. Economic activity continued to expand in the major foreign industrial countries in the third quarter, but growth apparently was at a more moderate pace than in the first half of the year. ']
