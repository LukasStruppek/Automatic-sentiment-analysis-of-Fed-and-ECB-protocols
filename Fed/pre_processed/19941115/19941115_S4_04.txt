[' With regard to possible changes in policy during the period until the next meeting, a majority of the members favored associating the more substantial policy adjustment with a symmetric intermeeting instruction. This preference was based on expectations that a further policy action was not likely to be called for over the near term, although a symmetric directive would not prevent an intermeeting adjustment if near-term developments differed substantially from expectations. One member expressed the view that the unusually large move made it especially important to follow a steady policy course for some period of time and to undertake any further firming only if new information of a surprisingly strong nature were to be received. Another member indicated a preference for an asymmetric directive toward restraint because such a directive would be more consistent with the likely need in his view for further monetary restraint to contain inflationary forces in the economy.
