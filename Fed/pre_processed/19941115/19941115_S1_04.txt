[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the growth of the economy remained substantial. Consumer spending was robust, business fixed investment continued on a strong upward trend, and housing activity had been well sustained despite the increase in mortgage interest rates over the past year. Business inventory investment had been brisk since the spring, apparently in response to the strong growth in final sales. Further sizable gains had been recorded in industrial production and employment. Increases in labor compensation were still moderate, although there were some tentative signs of wage acceleration associated with the further tightening of labor markets. Prices of many materials continued to move up rapidly, but broad indexes did not indicate a pickup in consumer inflation. ']
