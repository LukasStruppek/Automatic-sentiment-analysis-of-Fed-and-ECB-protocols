Fiscal policy was providing considerable stimulus to the economy and would continue to do so in the first part of this year, reflecting the large tax refunds anticipated as a result of overwithholdings in 2003. Beyond the nearer term, however, the fiscal stimulus was projected to diminish under existing legislation. In this regard, one member questioned whether a robust expansion would be sustained once the fiscal impulse was removed. Some members expressed concern about the longer-run prospects for large federal deficits and their implications for the future performance of the economy.
