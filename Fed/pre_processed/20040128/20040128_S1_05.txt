The members also discussed the possible advantages of making some changes in the content, time horizon, and frequency of the individual forecasts that are summarized in the semi-annual Monetary Policy Reports to the Congress. In general, the members saw little to be gained by altering the Committeeâ€™s current practices in any significant way, although some proposed relatively minor changes. It was agreed that there was no need to reach a decision on such changes at this time, but staff was instructed to ascertain the degree of interest on the part of the members in making possible minor adjustments to current procedures.
