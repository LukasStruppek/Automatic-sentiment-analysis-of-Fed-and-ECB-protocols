At its meeting on December 9, 2003, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate at around 1 percent. In reaching this decision, the Committee members generally perceived the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters to be roughly equal. They also judged that the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation had diminished in recent months and now appeared almost equal to that of a rise in inflation. Nevertheless, with inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be maintained for a considerable period.
