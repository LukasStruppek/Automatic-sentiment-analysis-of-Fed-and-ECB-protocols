The pace of expansion in the industrial sector picked up in the fourth quarter. Total industrial production rose at the fastest rate since the second quarter of 2002, and manufacturing production posted solid and widespread gains. High-tech industries, including those producing semiconductors, computers, and communications equipment, accounted for nearly one-third of the increase in total industrial production in the fourth quarter. After having surged in the third quarter, the production of motor vehicles and parts moved up in the fourth quarter at about the same rate as overall manufacturing. Outside the manufacturing sector, output at mines increased modestly in the quarter, while output at utilities rose appreciably, led by a solid advance in electricity generation that mirrored the strengthening in the manufacturing sector. Capacity utilization was unchanged in December and remained well below its long-term average.
