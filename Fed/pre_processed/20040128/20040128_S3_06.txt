The household sector was continuing to supply major impetus to the expansion. Household spending was benefiting from stimulative fiscal and monetary policies, the wealth effects of rising real estate and equity prices, and increased consumer confidence about the economic outlook. Members noted that retailers in many parts of the country reported solid sales during the holiday period. With respect to the outlook for overall consumer spending, it was suggested that the elevated growth of productivity could be expected to raise incomes over time and thereby help to buttress consumption even as the stimulus from earlier tax cuts faded. Residential construction activity remained at a high level, evidently supported in part by recent declines in mortgage interest rates. Contacts in the housing industry indicated that they expected a high level of construction activity in 2004, though perhaps not as robust as in 2003.
