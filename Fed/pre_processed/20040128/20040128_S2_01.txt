The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that the momentum in economic activity that had built up in the second half of 2003 would carry over into the first half of the current year and that the ongoing gains in spending and production would soon result in a more visible improvement in labor market conditions. The considerable stimulus being provided by fiscal and monetary policies was expected to keep aggregate demand on a solid uptrend. In addition, improving labor market conditions and the effects of strong productivity growth on permanent income were projected to support household spending, while business investment spending was seen as strengthening in response to the acceleration in business output, swelling profits, and continued favorable financing conditions. Some slight downward pressure on core consumer price inflation was anticipated in the forecast given the ongoing slack in labor and product markets.
