The December employment report suggested that the labor market had not gained as much momentum as previously appeared to be under way. Private nonfarm payrolls increased only slightly in that month, and their level in November was revised down appreciably. The average monthly increase in employment in the fourth quarter was indicative of a fairly weak recovery in the labor market, although it was a clear improvement over the average monthly loss during the first half of the year. Manufacturing payrolls continued to shrink in December at about the same pace as in the previous few months, and holiday-related hiring in retail trade was below average. In other sectors, job gains were recorded in construction, education and health services, and professional and business services. Average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers declined somewhat in December, reversing the gains of the previous two months. Aggregate hours worked by nonfarm employees fell in December but in the fourth quarter as a whole posted their first quarterly increase since 2000. Despite the weak payroll data, the unemployment rate, which is measured by the household survey, fell to 5.7 percent in December, in part because of a further decline in the labor force participation rate. Initial claims for unemployment insurance continued to drift down in the weeks following the reference week for the December employment report, suggesting improved job growth in January.
