The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles posted the third consecutive significant monthly increase in November. Stocks at manufacturers were down a little on average in October and November, but non-auto wholesalers and retailers accumulated inventories at a brisk pace. Strong increases in sales, however, kept book-value inventory-sales ratios at or near their recent lows. Motor vehicle and parts inventories ended the year noticeably above the level at the end of the third quarter.
