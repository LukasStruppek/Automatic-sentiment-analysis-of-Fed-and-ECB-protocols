Sales of light vehicles jumped in December, and the fourth-quarter average, although below the torrid third-quarter pace, was well above that recorded for the first half of the year. These data, along with those on retail sales excluding autos, were consistent with a solid increase in real personal consumption expenditures in the fourth quarter. Real disposable personal income advanced smartly in November. Spending was also supported by the recent stock market gains, and by greater consumer confidence as reflected in the Michigan Survey Research Center’s index of consumer sentiment and the Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence, both of which stood significantly above their average readings for 2003.
