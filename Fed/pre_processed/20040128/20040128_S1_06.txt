The economy appeared to have expanded at a robust pace in the fourth quarter, though well below the exceptional pace recorded in the third quarter. Consumer spending continued to increase at a solid rate over the final three months of the year, and activity in the residential sector remained at a very high level. On the business side, outlays for equipment and software likely posted moderate gains in the fourth quarter, and firms apparently accumulated inventories for the first time in three quarters. Despite the strong pace of economic activity, the labor market was improving only slowly, with private payrolls showing a small acceleration in the fourth quarter. Core consumer price inflation continued to slow, and inflation expectations remained subdued over the closing months of 2003.
