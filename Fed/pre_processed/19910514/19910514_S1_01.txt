The information reviewed at this meeting provides mixed signals regarding the course of economic activity, which had weakened appreciably further earlier in the year. Following sharp decreases in previous months, total nonfarm payroll employment fell somewhat further in April; the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 6.6 percent. Industrial output changed little in April after declining markedly in earlier months. Retail sales were about unchanged in April and are now indicated to have risen somewhat in March. Advance indicators continue to point to weakness in business fixed investment in coming months. Housing starts were down in March, partly offsetting a sizable advance in February, but sales of new and existing homes continued to rise. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit declined in February and its January-February rate was considerably below the average rate in the fourth quarter. Producer and consumer prices were little changed over March and April, partly reflecting further reductions in energy prices.
