[' Turning to possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period ahead, the members endorsed a proposal to return to an unbiased intermeeting instruction that did not incorporate any presumption with regard to the direction of possible intermeeting policy changes.

The Committee retained its fundamental objectives of fostering economic expansion at a sustainable pace that was consistent with further progress over time toward stable prices. However, it now appeared less likely than at the time of the May and July meetings that the Committee needed to bias its consideration of responses to incoming information in the intermeeting period toward possible tightening in order to achieve those objectives. One member, while agreeing that a tightening move would not be appropriate under current circumstances, nonetheless believed that monetary policy had been overly stimulative for some time and that the Committee should move toward restraint at the first favorable opportunity.
