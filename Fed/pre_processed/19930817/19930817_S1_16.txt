[" M2 expanded only slightly in July after growing appreciably over the second quarter. The continued strength of inflows to bond and stock mutual funds suggested that households were still realigning their portfolios toward assets outside the monetary aggregates. Through July, M2 was estimated to have grown at a rate close to the lower end of the Committee's range for the year. M3 contracted slightly in June and July, owing in part to a substantial drop in institution-only money market mutual funds, whose returns had not kept pace with the increase in money market rates in late spring. In addition, depository institutions placed greater reliance on various nondeposit sources of funds, including the issuance of equity and subordinated debt. Through July, M3 had declined a little and was slightly below its annual range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had expanded at a moderate rate in recent months, and for the year through June was estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.
