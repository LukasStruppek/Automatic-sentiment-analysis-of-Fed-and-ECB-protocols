[' The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested moderate growth in economic activity and modest reductions in margins of unemployed labor and capital through next year. The fiscal restraint stemming from the recent legislation and uncertainty about other government policies would act as a drag on the economy. On the other hand, lower interest rates were expected to contribute to further gains in spending on consumer durables, housing, and business fixed investment. Continued expansion also would be supported by further improvements in the availability of credit, a small boost to production over the next several quarters associated with rebuilding activity in areas of the Midwest affected by the recent floods, and a pickup in foreign demand resulting from some strengthening in economic activity abroad. The projected slack in labor and product markets, coupled with some tempering of inflation expectations, was expected to foster modest further reductions in wage and price inflation. ']
