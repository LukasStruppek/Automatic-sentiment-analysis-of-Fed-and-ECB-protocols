[' Business inventories expanded moderately during the second quarter, and inventory accumulation was broadly in line with sales over the first half of the year. In manufacturing, stocks edged lower in June, reflecting a further decline in inventories held by aircraft producers. Outside of the aircraft industry, inventory changes were mixed. For manufacturing as a whole, the ratio of inventories to shipments fell in June to one of the lowest levels in recent years. In the wholesale trade sector, inventories expanded modestly in June, and with sales lower, the inventory-to-sales ratio for the sector increased slightly. Retail inventories, after changing little in May, rose slightly more than sales in June, and the stocks-to-sales ratio for the retail sector remained near the high end of its range for the past several years.
