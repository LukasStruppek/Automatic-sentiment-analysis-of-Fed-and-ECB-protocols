[" Moreover, there was no compelling evidence that current monetary policy was fostering credit flows usually associated with speculative excesses or impending increases in price pressures. Growth in the broad measures of money and in the debt of nonfinancial sectors remained fairly damped despite indications of greater willingness to supply credit by banks, other financial intermediaries, and investors in securities markets. With regard to the monetary aggregates, low short-term interest rates undoubtedly were contributing to large shifts of funds from depository institutions, notably from components of M2 and M3 to stock and bond mutual funds and to other financial instruments, and thus to the sluggish behavior of the broad measures of money. In this connection, a staff analysis pointed to continuing slow growth in M2 over the near term and, on the assumption of little or no change in the degree of pressure on reserve positions, to growth for the year at a rate around the lower end of the Committee's range. Growth in M3 was likely to fall marginally below the Committee's range for the year. On the other hand, growth in Ml and in various reserve measures was expected to remain relatively robust. "]
