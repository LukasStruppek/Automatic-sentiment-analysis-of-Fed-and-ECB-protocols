[' Business contacts and other sources of information suggested little change since the July meeting in the pace or composition of economic activity in different parts of the country. Descriptions of economic performance varied from slow to moderate growth in most regions, though business activity probably continued to weaken in some major areas such as California. Despite sustained, if not ebullient, growth in sales to consumers and the relative strength in business investment spending in the first half of this year, business sentiment was widely described as cautious or negative even in some regions whose economies were outperforming the nation as a whole. According to business contacts, the recent enactment of deficit-reduction legislation had tended to mitigate concerns about the size of future federal deficits, but business executives were now focusing on the implications of higher taxes and many were expressing apprehension about further though still unannounced tax increases that might be associated with health care reform. Business sentiment and sales also were being affected adversely in many areas by cutbacks in defense contracts and closings of military installations and by the weakness in foreign demand for some products.
