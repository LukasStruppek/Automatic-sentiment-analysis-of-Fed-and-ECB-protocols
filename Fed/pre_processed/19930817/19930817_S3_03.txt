[' With regard to developments and prospects in key sectors of the economy, members noted that despite further survey indications of eroding consumer confidence, consumer expenditures had strengthened in recent months after a pause earlier in the year. The pickup had featured rising sales of motor vehicles, and while the latter had slipped recently, a number of special factors such as shortages of popular models at the end of the model year and the effects of flooding in some parts of the Midwest suggested the need to withhold judgment on any downward shift in the underlying demand for motor vehicles. Tourism was reported to have strengthened considerably in many areas this summer, though there were major exceptions. As had been true for an extended period, consumer attitudes continued to be inhibited by concerns about employment opportunities, especially given further reductions in defense spending, the ongoing restructuring and related downsizing of many business operations, and the continuing efforts by business firms to limit the number of their permanent employees in order to hold down the rising costs of health care and other nonwage worker benefits. Members noted, however, that the growth in employment thus far this year, while tending to involve many low paying jobs, had greatly exceeded the rate of expansion in 1992. In the view of at least some members, appreciable further growth was likely as business firms found it increasingly difficult in an expanding economy to meet growing demands through outsourcing, temporary workers, and overtime work. Some members also noted that the newly legislated taxes on higher incomes would tend to curtail some consumer spending. The timing of that effect was uncertain; tax liabilities had already risen, but some payments on the added tax liabilities were not due until April of 1994 and 1995. ']
