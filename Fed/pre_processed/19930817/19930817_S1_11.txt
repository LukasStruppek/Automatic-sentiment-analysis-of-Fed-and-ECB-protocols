[' Producer prices of finished goods declined in July for a second consecutive month. Prices of finished foods edged lower, and prices of finished energy goods, particularly gasoline and fuel oil fell significantly; excluding the food and energy components, producer prices edged up in July and to that point in the year had risen at a slightly lower rate than was recorded in 1992. At the consumer level, prices for nonfood, non-energy items were up slightly in both June and July and for the year to date had increased a little more slowly than last year. Hourly compensation for private industry workers rose in the second quarter at about the rate seen last year. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers were unchanged on balance over June and July, but for the year through July these earnings had increased at the same pace as in 1992. ']
