[" Money market interest rates were little changed on balance over the intermeeting period, while rates on intermediate-term U.S. Treasury obligations and on fixed-rate mortgages dropped slightly. Yields on long-term Treasury and corporate bonds were down by more, with the rate on the 30-year Treasury bond falling below 6-1/2 percent. Many market interest rates moved higher after Chairman Greenspan's congressional testimony on July 20, which was perceived by market participants as suggesting a greater likelihood of some tightening of monetary policy in the future. Subsequently, interest rates generally retreated in reaction to incoming economic data indicating subdued inflation pressures and to the passage of the deficit-reduction legislation. Major indexes of stock prices increased somewhat over the intermeeting period. "]
