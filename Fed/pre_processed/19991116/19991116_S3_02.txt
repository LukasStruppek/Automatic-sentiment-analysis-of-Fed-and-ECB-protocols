With regard to the prospective performance of key sectors of the economy, forecasts of somewhat slower growth in consumer spending appeared to be supported by recent reports of some moderation in sales of motor vehicles from extraordinarily high levels. Anecdotal reports relating to recent retail sales around the country were mixed, but members indicated that their contacts in the retail industry were uniformly optimistic about the outlook for sales during the holiday season and recent surveys suggested a very high level of consumer confidence. Retail sales might be also augmented during the closing weeks of the year by precautionary purchases related to century date change concerns. Looking ahead, and abstracting from the unwinding in the early part of 2000 of some transitory stockpiling of consumer goods, growth in consumer spending seemed likely to moderate over time. In part, forecasts of a less ebullient consumer sector reflected expectations of reduced demand for household goods associated with a mild downturn in housing activity and the previous slowdown in mortgage refinancings that had lowered household debt servicing burdens and frequently had made accumulated housing equity available for consumer expenditures. A potentially more important factor in the outlook for consumer spending, however, was the prospect that the wealth effects from sharp earlier increases in the value of stock market holdings would wane in the absence of a new upsurge in stock market prices.
