Growth of consumer spending apparently had moderated somewhat further recently, but surveys indicated that consumer confidence continued to be high and personal income rose briskly in the third quarter. Total nominal retail sales changed little in September and October, with purchases at auto dealerships falling in both months and sales at other stores growing less rapidly on balance. Housing activity weakened somewhat over the summer but was still at a high level. Some of the drop in housing starts in September probably was attributable to unusually heavy rains in parts of the South and Northeast. In addition, sales of both new and existing homes declined appreciably in September.
