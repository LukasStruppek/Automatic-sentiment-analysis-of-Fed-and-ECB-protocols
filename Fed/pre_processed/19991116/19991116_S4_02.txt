All the members accepted a proposal to adopt a symmetric directive. Such a directive was viewed as consistent with the Committee's current expectation that no further policy move was likely to be considered before the Committee's meeting in February. In the circumstances, a Committee decision to retain the existing asymmetry toward tightening could well send a misleading signal about the probability of near-term action and have an unsettling effect on financial markets at a time when concerns relating to the century date change might be adding to normal year-end pressures. As noted previously, however, views differed to some degree regarding the subsequent outlook for policy. On the basis of currently available information, a number of members indicated that they were quite uncertain about the possible need for further tightening action over coming months to keep inflation within acceptable limits. Continued favorable price and unit cost data, driven in part by improving productivity, suggested that any further action should depend on incoming information about economic activity, pressures on resources, and inflation. Other members, emphasizing the persistently strong growth in economic activity and the unusually high level of labor resource utilization, suggested that additional firming of the stance of policy probably would be necessary to keep inflation in check and hence maintain the favorable backdrop for maximum economic growth. However, in view of the questions surrounding the outlook, the amount of firming already undertaken by the Committee this year including at this meeting and its uncertain effects, and the special situation in financial markets over the year-end, they supported the adoption of a symmetric directive.
