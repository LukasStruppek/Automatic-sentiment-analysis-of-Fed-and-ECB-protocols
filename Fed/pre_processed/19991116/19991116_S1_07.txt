The expansion of business fixed investment picked up sharply in the third quarter, as a marked acceleration in outlays for durable equipment and computer software more than offset a further weakening of nonresidential construction activity. The strength in spending for durable equipment was concentrated in computer hardware and transportation equipment; the latter included medium and heavy trucks, fleet sales of light vehicles, and commercial aircraft. Outlays for computer software and communications equipment also were up appreciably. Trends in orders suggested that the buoyancy in business spending for capital equipment had continued into the fourth quarter. Weakness in nonresidential building activity in the third quarter was widespread, though office construction remained on a solid upward trend.
