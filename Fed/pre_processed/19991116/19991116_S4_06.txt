At this meeting, the working group chaired by Mr. Ferguson provided an interim report on its work to date concerning the wording of the Committee's directives, the Committee's announcements after each meeting, and related issues. The members expressed broad agreement with the direction of the working group's tentative recommendations and provided feedback on specific issues and wording. It was contemplated that the Committee would consider the working group's final report at a meeting in the near future.
