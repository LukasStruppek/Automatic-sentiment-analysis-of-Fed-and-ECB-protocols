Consumer prices increased at a slightly faster rate in September, with a further large rise in energy prices a contributing factor. Core consumer inflation also picked up in September, in part because of a sharp jump in tobacco prices. Nonetheless, core consumer prices rose less over the twelve months ended in September than over the preceding twelve-month period. At the producer level, price inflation for finished goods other than food and energy items slowed appreciably in October from the elevated September rate, which had been boosted by the tobacco price increase. For the year ended in October, core producer prices rose appreciably more than in the preceding year. Measured on a year-over-year basis, labor compensation rose more slowly in the year ending in the third quarter than it had in the preceding year. However, the increase in the third quarter was a little larger than the subdued average pace for the first half of the year; the step-up was entirely attributable to larger increases in benefits. Average hourly earnings edged up in October after a large rise in September. For the twelve months ended in October, average hourly earnings decelerated slightly from the previous twelve months.
