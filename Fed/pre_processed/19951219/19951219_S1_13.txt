[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services changed little in September (latest data available). Measured on a quarterly average basis, however, the deficit declined substantially in the third quarter, with the reduction about equally divided between a rise in the value of exports and a drop in the value of imports. Increases in exports were widespread among the major categories of trade, while reductions in imports were concentrated in categories in which there had been large gains in the second quarter. Available data pointed to subdued growth in most of the major foreign industrial countries in the second half of 1995. ']
