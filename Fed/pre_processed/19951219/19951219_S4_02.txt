[" A number of members, though willing to accept a slight easing, preferred an unchanged policy stance. While inflation had slowed from the elevated pace observed in the early part of the year, there was little hard evidence to indicate that it would decline any further over the forecast horizon or that there had been a significant increase in the sustainable growth rate of the economy. A few members also expressed concern about the possible repercussions in financial markets of an easing action that would follow an already strong rally in bond and stock prices. In the circumstances, these members questioned whether a somewhat easier policy stance would prove consistent with the Committee's objective of fostering further progress toward price stability. Moreover, although the available evidence on the economy's current performance remained mixed, the moderation in economic growth after the third-quarter surge did not seem at this time to signal a growing shortfall of the economy from its potential. Instead, the economy was likely in this view to continue to grow at a generally acceptable rate at or near capacity, and a few members saw some potential for somewhat faster growth at a pace that over time could intensify inflationary pressures. Accordingly, they preferred to wait for further evidence on inflation trends and the performance of the economy, but they indicated that in light of the uncertainties that were involved and the small amount of easing that was proposed they would not dissent from the majority position.
