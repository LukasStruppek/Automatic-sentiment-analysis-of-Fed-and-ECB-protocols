[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective developments, members noted that the information that had become available since the November meeting tended to confirm earlier indications that the economic expansion had slowed appreciably from the brisk pace of the summer months. The members generally agreed that the most likely course for the economy remained one of moderate growth. Expansion at or near potential was seen as the most probable outcome, associated at least in part with the favorable effects on business and consumer spending of lower interest rates, higher equity prices, and an ample availability of credit. However, a number of members expressed concern that the strength of final demands would not be sufficient to support growth near the economy's potential, absent a policy adjustment. One factor that might retard growth was a higher level of real short-term interest rates owing to the favorable performance of inflation. Members noted that consumer price increases had remained relatively subdued and below expectations in recent months, despite the generally high levels of utilization of both labor and capital resources that had prevailed through much of the year. Several commented that the effects of new technologies, gains in productivity, global competitive pressures on businesses, and restraint in wage setting might imply that inflation would edge down further. Others expressed concern that the prospects for further reductions in inflation seemed quite limited in the context of projected high levels of resource use, including tight labor markets in many parts of the country.
