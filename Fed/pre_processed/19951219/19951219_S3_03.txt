[' In their discussion of developments in key sectors of the economy, members commented that the data and the anecdotal information on consumer spending had been mixed. For the holiday season, reports indicated that retail sales had been disappointing thus far, though sales appeared to be holding up relatively well in some sections of the country and for higher-priced luxury items more generally. Consumers had remained very cautious despite considerable promotional sales activity, perhaps anticipating even more aggressive markdowns of prices as the shopping season neared its end. Members noted that the reluctance of consumers also might be reflecting a sense of continued job insecurity in an environment of ongoing business restructuring and downsizing, higher debt service burdens and rising delinquency rates, and the satisfaction of pent-up demand for durable goods. While these factors might be exerting an inhibiting influence on consumers, the members generally viewed moderate growth in consumer spending as a reasonable expectation in the context of further projected expansion in disposable incomes. The increase in household wealth associated with the strong performance of the bond and stock markets might tend to boost consumer spending relative to disposable incomes, although one member suggested that the highly concentrated nature of wealth holdings might limit any positive effect on aggregate consumption. With regard to housing, members took note of the recent declines in single-family housing starts and sales after a strong third quarter. They remarked, however, that some of their contacts were anticipating that the declines in mortgage interest rates over recent months to their current relatively low levels would foster a wave of mortgage refinancing and a pickup in housing demand in the spring.
