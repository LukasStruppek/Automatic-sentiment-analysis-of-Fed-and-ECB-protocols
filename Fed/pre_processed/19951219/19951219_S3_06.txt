[' In reviewing the outlook for inflation, members referred to the generally favorable price and cost experience of recent months. Several pointed to subdued increases in labor compensation and to anecdotal indications that upward pressures on wages and benefits remained scattered despite tightness in many labor markets. In this environment, and with the economy expected to expand at a comparatively moderate pace over the forecast period, many members anticipated that inflation would remain relatively stable despite continuing high levels of resource utilization, and some believed that it might record a somewhat improved performance. One argument advanced in support of a possibly better performance was that the recent experience, which had been more favorable than expected given capacity utilization levels, was perhaps suggestive of the effects of rapid technological improvements on productivity, the enhanced efficiencies from greater economic specialization around the world, and the influence of heightened job insecurity on wages and prices. Another was the possible effect on future wage demands of the lower inflation expectations that now prevailed. Although no member saw greater inflation as having a high probability, several did refer to risks in that direction, including the possibility of greater pressures on resources stemming from faster than currently anticipated economic growth.
