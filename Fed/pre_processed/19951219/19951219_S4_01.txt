[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members either favored or could accept a slight easing in the degree of pressure on reserve positions. One argument cited in favor of some easing was that the policy stance, as indexed by the prevailing real federal funds rate, was becoming somewhat restrictive as inflation and inflationary expectations moderated, leaving real short-term rates higher than anticipated. In addition, with markets expecting a reduction in the federal funds rate in coming months, an unchanged policy was likely to lead to a backup in intermediate- and long-term rates. Although there was no sign that a cumulative deterioration in economic performance was about to get under way, the downside risks to the expansion appeared to have increased and a modest easing would better position policy to guard against the possibility that over the longer term the expansion would begin to fall short of the economy's potential, especially with fiscal policy likely to be at least moderately restrictive. In any case, the recent slowing of the economic expansion, combined with the wage and price restraint evident at current levels of resource utilization and continuing business efforts to expand capacity, suggested that there was little risk of a pickup in inflation. Indeed, the favorable inflation experience over the last half year raised the possibility of continued modest price improvement. "]
