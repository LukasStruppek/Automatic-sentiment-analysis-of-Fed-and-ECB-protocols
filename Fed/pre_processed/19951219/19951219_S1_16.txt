[' Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period. The federal funds rate averaged a bit above the expected rate of 5-3/4 percent over the period. The bunching of settlements of several Treasury issues that had resulted from debt ceiling disruptions and the mid-December corporate tax date were among the factors exerting pressure on the funds rate. Most other short-term interest rates fell slightly and longer-term interest rates extended earlier declines during the intermeeting period. Market expectations of some easing of monetary policy appeared to be reinforced by market interpretations of the incoming information as further evidence that overall demand would be restrained and that the risks of a pickup in inflationary pressures had diminished. Over the intermeeting interval, major indexes of stock prices continued to move higher in concert with the rise in bond prices. ']
