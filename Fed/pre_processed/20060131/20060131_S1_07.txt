Real outlays for equipment and software appeared to have slowed significantly in the fourth quarter, as expenditures for transportation and communications equipment reversed some of their earlier sharp increases. With few exceptions, however, new orders appeared to be quite strong, and order backlogs increased for several goods in the transportation sector. Underlying fundamentals continued to support gains in capital spending as business sector output expanded, firms remained flush with funds, and relative price declines pushed down the user cost of capital equipment. Anecdotal reports and surveys also indicated that businesses were optimistic about near-term capital spending plans. Vacancy rates for nonresidential properties drifted lower as construction expenditures on commercial and manufacturing structures remained well below recent peaks. However, spending on drilling and mining structures continued to increase strongly. Business investment in real nonfarm inventories increased moderately in the fourth quarter, boosted by a rapid accumulation of motor vehicle inventories. Outside of motor vehicles, stocks continued to rise slowly. The restrained growth in inventories in recent months suggested that firms outside the motor vehicle sector were intentionally keeping stockbuilding low; however, it could also have reflected an unanticipated increase in sales or supply interruptions following the hurricanes last fall. That said, the level of stocks appeared reasonably well aligned with demand in most industries.
