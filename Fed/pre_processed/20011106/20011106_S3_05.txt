A key uncertainty in the outlook for investment spending was the outcome of the ongoing Congressional debate relating to tax incentives for investment in equipment and software. Both the passage and the specific contents of such legislation remained in question. Moreover, several members stressed the difficulty of assessing the effectiveness of temporary fiscal policy measures directed at boosting investment expenditures. Though undoubtedly helpful in fostering greater capital spending while the tax incentives remained in place, members expressed reservations about the extent of the favorable effects in the nearer term when marked disincentives existed for many firms to make capital expenditures in the context of excess capacity, weak markets, and poor profit opportunities. More generally, forecasts of a reasonably vigorous rebound in the economy over 2002 depended in part on expectations of added fiscal stimulus, but prospects appeared to have diminished for prompt passage of fiscal policy initiatives that could significantly boost economic activity in the next several quarters.
