A number of members noted that the choice between 25 and 50 basis points of easing was a close call. Three favored a smaller move on balance, although they could accept the larger decrease in the current environment of substantial uncertainty about the course of the economy and the appropriate stance of policy. These members noted that policy was already accommodative. Indeed, policy had been eased substantially further in September and October, and the effects of those actions and any added easing at this meeting would be felt mostly during the year ahead when fiscal stimulus and the inherent resilience of the economy should already be boosting growth substantially. Some also were concerned that the more sizable action in combination with an announcement of the Committee's continuing concern about further economic weakness would lead markets to build in inappropriate expectations of even more monetary stimulus.
