In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the major foreign currencies had increased slightly on balance since the October meeting. Incoming data for the foreign industrial economies were weaker than expected, and market interest rates abroad declined in response to reductions in policy interest rates in Canada and the United Kingdom and to market expectations that the European Central Bank would lower its policy rates by year-end. The dollar moved down slightly on balance in terms of an index of the currencies of other important trading partners. The Brazilian real was adversely affected by spillovers from Argentina's financial difficulties, while the Mexican peso rebounded from its decline against the dollar in the wake of the September terrorist attacks.
