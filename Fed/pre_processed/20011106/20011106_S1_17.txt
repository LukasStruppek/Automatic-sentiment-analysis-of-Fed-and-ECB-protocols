M2 changed little in October after a surge in September that was related in important measure to a temporary bulge in transaction deposits stemming largely from delayed settlements of security trades in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. On balance, M2 grew rapidly over the September-October period, reflecting the sharp drop in market interest rates and perhaps the deposit of federal tax rebates. M3 also increased rapidly over September and October, largely in conjunction with the expansion of M2. The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors grew at a moderate pace on balance through August.
