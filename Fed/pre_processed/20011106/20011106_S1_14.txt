At its meeting on October 2, 2001, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with a decrease of 50 basis points in the intended level of the federal funds rate, to about 2-1/2 percent. The members recognized that monetary policy already had been eased substantially this year, but they believed that the increased evidence of a faltering economy and the decidedly downside risks to the outlook called for a further move. The additional rate reduction would help limit the extent of the downturn and later would contribute to an upturn. Moreover, the recent declines in equity prices and widening of risk spreads tended to offset some of the stimulative effects of earlier easings, and the relatively low level of inflation and inflationary expectations provided room to counter downside forces without incurring significant risks of higher inflation. The members also believed that the balance of risks remained weighted toward conditions that could generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.
