Meeting participants commented in particular detail on the inflation situation. They noted with some concern the recent elevated readings on inflation in prices of core personal consumption expenditures, the producer price index, and indicators of prices at earlier stages of production, as well as the sizable further increase in energy prices. Nonetheless, many participants stated that they expected total inflation to diminish and any rise in core consumer inflation to be limited. One source of upward pressure on inflation had been the rise in energy prices, and it seemed reasonable to expect that these prices would level out or even decline mildly, as built into futures prices. Unit labor costs were still being held down by moderate wage growth and rising productivity. Indeed, a few saw a distinct possibility of further positive productivity surprises, representing a downside risk to the inflation outlook. Moreover, the markup of prices over costs in nonfarm businesses remained quite high, and firms would likely be pressed by competition to absorb a portion of any step-up in the growth of unit labor costs, at least if that acceleration were limited in extent and duration. In addition, prices of many non-energy commodities had risen in recent weeks, but such inputs constituted a relatively small fraction of overall business costs, and, partly for that reason, in the past commodity prices had demonstrated little predictive content for broad inflation rates. While short-term inflation expectations had risen somewhat, longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained. And lastly, monetary policy would be aimed at preserving price stability.
