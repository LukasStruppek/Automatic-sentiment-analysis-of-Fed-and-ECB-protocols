The Committee's decision to change the target rate was universally anticipated by market participants, as was the tenor of the statement. As a result, the reaction in financial markets was muted. Over the intermeeting period, however, the Chairman's semiannual testimony on monetary policy, higher oil prices, and incoming data that showed a pickup in price inflation led market participants to mark up their expectations for the trajectory of the target federal funds rate. Consistent with the upward revision to policy expectations, yields on Treasury securities rose significantly. Some of the increase in nominal rates likely owed to higher inflation expectations, as inflation compensation, measured from the spread between Treasury nominal debt and comparable inflation-indexed securities, rose. However, staff analysis suggested that the increases were concentrated over the next few years and that long-term inflation expectations were little changed. Risk spreads on most corporate bonds narrowed on balance, significantly so for speculative-grade debt, amid generally strong corporate balance sheets and good credit performance. Broad stock market indexes edged up over the intermeeting period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar depreciated slightly, with the declines widespread against the currencies of industrialized countries other than Japan.
