U.S. industrial activity was increasing steadily, pushing capacity utilization higher. Production was expanding in a broad range of manufacturing categories, notably including high-tech and defense industries. Business contacts indicated that the high level of energy prices was spurring coal mining activity. Drilling for oil and gas was also increasing, although extraction was said to be crimped in some instances by a scarcity of experienced rig hands as well as spot shortages of certain key production inputs, such as drilling pipe.
