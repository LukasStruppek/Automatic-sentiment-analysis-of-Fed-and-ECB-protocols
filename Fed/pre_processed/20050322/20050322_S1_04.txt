Industrial production posted a moderate gain in February, led by a surge in motor vehicle production. Production of high-tech equipment rose, with the increase in output of communications equipment far outpacing sluggish growth of computer production. Production of consumer goods, both durable and nondurable, also rose. In contrast, the production of non-high-tech business equipment edged down, and the output of construction and business supplies and materials dropped back. Mining output edged up, but the output of utilities fell for a second consecutive month amid a generally warm winter.
