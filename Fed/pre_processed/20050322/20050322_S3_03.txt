Spending on housing and consumer goods and services was also seen as underpinning economic expansion. With single-family housing starts at record levels, residential investment expenditures apparently continued to be spurred by relatively low interest rates. A few participants cited some evidence of speculative activity in the housing market in several regions. However, recent house price developments were mixed, with reports of incipient softness in some markets, including high-end properties, and overall house price inflation was seen as likely to slow in coming quarters. Consumer expenditures were expected to continue to advance at a solid pace, buoyed by strong gains in personal income, although high energy prices could exert some restraint on spending. The possibility of an appreciable rise in the personal saving rate, which was near its historical low, represented another possible downside risk to consumer spending. The recent sharp slowing in motor vehicle sales, which appeared to be related in part to the paring of purchase incentives and perhaps also to the high level of energy prices, raised some concerns about the expansion of economic activity in some regions.
