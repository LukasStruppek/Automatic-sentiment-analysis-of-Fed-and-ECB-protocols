Growth in unit labor costs had continued to be held down by growth of output per hour worked, which had continued to perform surprisingly well. Although productivity growth had slowed from the extraordinarily rapid pace that prevailed earlier in the expansion, data for the fourth quarter of 2004, as well as preliminary indications for the first quarter of this year, suggested that gains from efficiency remained substantial. Participants remarked that many business executives were seeking further advances in productivity through organizational improvements as well as through investment in equipment and software. Regarding the latter, some evidence suggested that rapid technological progress was being sustained, which would continue to drive down the cost of many forms of productive capital and thus boost returns on investment. Moreover, the stronger picture of capital spending that had emerged of late boded well for the performance of productivity going forward. Still, considerable uncertainty persisted about longer-run prospects for productivity growth, unit labor costs, and cost pressures on profits and prices.
