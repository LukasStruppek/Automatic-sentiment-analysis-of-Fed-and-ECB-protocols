Consumer prices edged higher in January after having been flat in December. Core consumer prices rose a bit faster than overall prices, with price increases widespread across commodities and services. Consumer energy prices fell in January but turned back up in February and early March. For the twelve-month period ended in January, overall consumer prices were boosted significantly by higher oil prices, but core consumer price inflation over the same period was fairly subdued. A survey measure of near-term inflation expectations moved up in early March, but long-term expectations had changed little since the end of last year. Producer prices and commodity indexes were broadly higher in January, with the exception of prices for core crude materials. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings rose slowly over January and February. Over the preceding year, compensation costs increased moderately, contributing to a small rise in unit labor costs.
