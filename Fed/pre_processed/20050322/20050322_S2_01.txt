In the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, the economy was seen as likely to expand at a rate above the growth of potential this year and next, led by strong business demand for equipment and software. Consequently, labor markets were expected to continue to firm and the unemployment rate to decline gradually. In light of the robust expansion of capital spending thus far this year, the outlook for business investment spending was revised up appreciably, as more of the strength over the latter part of 2004 was attributed to underlying demand and less to the effects of the partial-expensing tax provision. Steadily rising sales, an ongoing need to replace and upgrade software and equipment, and favorable financing costs were all expected to continue to buoy business spending this year and next. Household spending, supported by rising disposable income and, to a lesser degree, by increasing wealth, was projected to expand at a solid rate. Net exports were seen as exerting less of an arithmetic drag on economic growth than in 2004. Measures of overall consumer price inflation were expected to be lower this year than last and to step down again next year as energy prices retreated. Inflation in core consumer prices was seen as being boosted a bit by the effects of higher import and energy costs in the near term but still largely contained by continued strong growth in underlying labor productivity and remaining slack in resource markets.
