Supported by strong income gains and higher wealth, consumer spending had increased at a robust rate in the last quarter of 2004 and appeared to be on track to post another strong advance in the first quarter of the year. Apart from purchases of motor vehicles, which stepped down early this year after a year-end surge, the increases in outlays had been broad based. On average, real disposable income increased at a vigorous pace in December and January, well above that seen over most of last year. Increases in equity prices and in house values pushed up the wealth-to-income ratio in the fourth quarter, and the saving rate remained low by historical standards.
