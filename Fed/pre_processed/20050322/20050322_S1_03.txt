The labor market continued to improve in February. Private nonfarm payrolls grew at a solid pace, and these gains were widespread across industries. Of particular note, manufacturing employment, which had been declining, edged higher. On balance, surveys of employers and of households pointed to firming labor demand. With the average workweek unchanged, aggregate hours increased moderately in February. Although the unemployment rate in February ticked back up to its December level, the set of available information on the labor market suggested that resource slack was diminishing.
