Indicators from the labor market were generally strong through November. Nonfarm payrolls increased at a solid pace, while revisions to previous estimates showed a larger gain, on balance, over the preceding two months. Employment in manufacturing and construction industries fell in November, but hiring continued to be brisk in the professional and nonbusiness service industries. Aggregate weekly hours of private production or nonsupervisory workers edged up. The unemployment rate had fallen to 4.4 percent in October but ticked back up to 4.5 percent in November, remaining below the average of 4.7 percent during the first three quarters of the year.
