The information reviewed at the December meeting suggested that economic activity was increasing at a subdued rate during the second half of the year. The contraction in homebuilding was continuing to restrain overall activity, and a step-down in motor vehicle output held down industrial production. In contrast, consumer spending and business investment were increasing at a moderate rate, and payroll employment expanded solidly through November. Additional sharp declines in energy prices reduced total consumer price inflation in October, but the twelve-month change in core prices remained above its year-earlier level.
