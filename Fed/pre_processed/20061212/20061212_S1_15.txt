Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors in the third quarter expanded at around its second-quarter pace. Business debt rose slightly more slowly than in the second quarter, in part reflecting reduced borrowing in the bond and commercial paper markets. In the household sector, mortgage debt increased at its lowest pace since the late 1990s, reflecting the continued deceleration in house prices. M2 rose more strongly in October and November than it had in preceding months.
