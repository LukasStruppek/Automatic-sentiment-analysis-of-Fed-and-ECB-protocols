Participants noted that recent indicators provided mixed signals about the strength of near-term activity. Solid gains in employment over recent quarters stood in contrast to the softer pace of economic expansion suggested by the spending and production data. That difference most likely reflected lags between movements in activity and employment, implying that growth in employment would probably slow over the next quarter or so. Participants suggested that other forces might be at work as well. The growth of structural labor productivity could be weaker than currently thought, helping to reconcile the steady growth in employment with more subdued advances in spending and output. Moreover, the recent pace of activity may have been stronger than that indicated by the spending and production data. With regard to this possibility, it was noted that gross domestic income had grown substantially more quickly than measured GDP over the past year.
