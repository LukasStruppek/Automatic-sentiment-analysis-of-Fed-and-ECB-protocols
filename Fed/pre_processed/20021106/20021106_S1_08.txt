Business fixed investment edged up in the third quarter, as a pickup in expenditures for equipment and software nearly offset a further sharp decline in spending on nonresidential structures. The return to positive growth of spending for equipment and software was led by robust business outlays for computers and peripheral equipment and for motor vehicles. By contrast, investment in telecommunications equipment and aircraft remained on a steep downward trend. Nonresidential construction activity also continued to decline rapidly, with considerable further reductions in all major categories.
