In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that the recent data on the performance of the economy had been disappointing and had tended to confirm widespread anecdotal indications that economic growth had slowed to a pace well below that experienced earlier in the year. Even so, the members acknowledged that the economy had displayed remarkable resiliency over the past year despite being subjected to severe adverse shocks. While the latter clearly had taken their toll on confidence, notably in the business sector, consumer spending had held up relatively well. Business investment expenditures continued to be constrained by a high degree of uncertainty and related caution. Looking beyond the near term, the members anticipated that as the prevailing uncertainties began to diminish, the economy's resiliency abetted by broadly accommodative monetary and fiscal polices and the continuation of a strong uptrend in productivity would underpin a gradual economic recovery. Indeed, some members commented that an even more robust recovery could not be ruled out in the absence of further major shocks to confidence. With pressures on labor and other resources expected to be limited over coming quarters, inflation was likely to remain subdued and perhaps even to edge a little lower.
