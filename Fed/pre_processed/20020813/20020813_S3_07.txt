Business inventories edged up in the second quarter after declining persistently since early 2001. Indeed, the strengthening was sufficient to account for the small advance in GDP in the latest quarter. With inventories now apparently close to desired levels in many sectors of the economy and reportedly below such levels for some retailers, the expected strengthening in final sales would probably foster some inventory accumulation over coming quarters, thereby adding impetus to the projected growth of the economy.
