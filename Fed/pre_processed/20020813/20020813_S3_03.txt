In their review of demand prospects in key sectors of the economy, members noted that household spending was continuing to play a key role in sustaining the expansion. Retail sales, buttressed by strength in motor vehicles, had been well maintained in recent months despite survey evidence of declining consumer confidence. The extraction of funds from increases in home equity evidently remained an important source of financing for household expenditures, especially including outlays for home modernization. Looking ahead, the anticipated pickup in employment and related gains in incomes, undergirded by continued robust growth in structural productivity, was seen as supporting further expansion in consumer spending. Some members commented, however, that the declines in equity wealth and the possible persistence of turmoil in equity markets might continue to restrain the pickup in consumer expenditures in the months ahead.
