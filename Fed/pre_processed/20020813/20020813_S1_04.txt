Private nonfarm payroll employment inched up in July after a mild increase in June, though aggregate hours worked by production or nonsupervisory workers declined steeply. The help-supply portion of the services sector and the construction industry recorded substantial net job losses over the June-July period, but manufacturing registered its smallest payroll decline in two years in July, and hiring was relatively brisk in services other than help-supply. The civilian unemployment rate edged up in June, to 5.9 percent, and was unchanged in July.
