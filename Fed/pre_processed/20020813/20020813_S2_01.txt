The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, in light of weaker-than-expected incoming economic data, the expansion of economic activity would pick up gradually over the next year and a half from the very sluggish pace of the second quarter. The considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place and the continuing sizable gains in structural productivity would provide significant impetus for spending, though the persisting volatility and weakness in equity prices would tend to offset some of that support. Inventory overhangs appeared to have been largely eliminated and business capital stocks to have moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a gradually improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to boost business investment spending. However, a less robust pickup in final sales was now expected over the forecast period, which would put somewhat less pressure on resource margins than had been anticipated previously, and the level of activity would remain below the economy's potential for a somewhat longer time. The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation.
