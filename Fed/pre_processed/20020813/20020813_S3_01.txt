In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that much of the incoming information on economic activity had been disappointing, and many indicated that they had marked down their growth forecasts for the months ahead. Even so, with recent weakness concentrated in volatile high-frequency data that might well prove to be transitory and with business and consumer confidence unlikely to deteriorate further in the absence of a major shock to the economy, members continued to place favorable odds on an underlying outlook of strengthening expansion. Factors cited for this positive outlook included the stimulative stances of fiscal and monetary policy, the apparent completion in most industries of efforts to bring inventories and capital facilities into desired alignment with expected sales, and the support to consumer incomes and business incentives provided by the continued rise in structural productivity. Further gains in productivity and the prospect for relatively contained demand pressures on resources, which were likely to be somewhat more limited for a time than members had anticipated earlier, would contribute to keeping price inflation subdued.
