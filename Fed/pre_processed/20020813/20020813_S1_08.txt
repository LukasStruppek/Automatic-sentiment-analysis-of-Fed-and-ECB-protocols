Business investment in equipment and structures declined further in the second quarter as the continuing downdraft in nonresidential construction more than offset a pickup in business spending for durable equipment and software. Despite gradually improving fundamentals--rising output and profits, new tax incentives, and a low cost of capital--firms remained cautious about stepping up their investments in equipment and software, and recent data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods coupled with anecdotal reports suggested further lackluster gains in spending in coming months. In the nonresidential construction sector, outlays for office, industrial, and other structures, lodging facilities, and public utilities declined substantially further. By contrast, construction of institutional structures was up again in the second quarter.
