 In a joint session of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets as well as System open market operations conducted during the period since the Committee met on October 28-29, 2014 In addition, the manager reviewed the implications of recent foreign central bank policy actions for the international portion of the SOMA portfolio The manager also provided an update on staff work related to potential arrangements that would allow depository institutions to pledge funds held in a segregated account at the Federal Reserve as collateral in borrowing transactions with private creditors and which could potentially provide an additional supplementary tool during policy normalization After further review, staff analysis suggested that such accounts involved a number of operational, regulatory, and policy issues These issues raised questions about these accounts' possible effectiveness that would be difficult to resolve in a timely fashion It was therefore decided that further work to implement such accounts would be shelved for now
