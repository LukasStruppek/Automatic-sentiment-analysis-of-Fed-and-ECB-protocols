Real consumer spending appeared to be on track to decelerate noticeably in the current quarter after posting robust growth in the first quarter. The slowing reflected both a marked reduction in the growth in real outlays for motor vehicles from an elevated first-quarter pace and a moderation in the advance of real expenditures for other goods in recent months. Underlying this slowing in the expansion of consumer expenditures was a moderation in the fundamental determinants of spending. The level of nominal wages and salaries beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005 was revised down considerably, and rising consumer prices held down the gains in real disposable income. Higher interest rates also likely restrained spending. Nonetheless, despite recent declines in equity prices, the wealth-to-income ratio remained well above its historical average, and consumer sentiment, which dipped in May, rebounded some in early June.
