After a first-quarter surge, real spending on equipment and software appeared on track for a much smaller gain in the second quarter. Incoming data for the current quarter suggested that spending on transportation equipment reversed the run-up that occurred in the first quarter. Spending on high-tech equipment and software advanced at a slower pace in the second quarter as a flattening out of spending on communications equipment after a huge increase in the first quarter offset some pickup in business-sector demand for computers and software. The construction of nonresidential buildings picked up noticeably so far this year, although activity remained well short of its previous peak in mid-2000. Outlays on drilling and mining structures continued to climb in response to high projected energy prices.
