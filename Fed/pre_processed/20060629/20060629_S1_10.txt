Headline inflation picked up in April and May, driven partly by sharp increases in the prices of petroleum-based products. In contrast, natural gas prices continued to decline in response to excess supply, fully reversing last autumn's rises. Higher oil prices showed through to producer prices for a variety of energy-intensive intermediate goods. Consumer food prices decelerated markedly since January, reflecting slower price increases for food away from home and declines, on balance, in the prices of fruits and vegetables. Core price inflation rose less than headline inflation in April and May but above its pace earlier in the year. Core prices were boosted in part by an acceleration in shelter costs, especially those imputed for owner-occupied residences. Readings on the growth of labor costs were revised down for the fourth quarter of 2005 and first quarter of 2006, but recent data suggested a pickup in the second quarter. A number of indicators of inflation expectations largely reversed increases recorded in the spring.
