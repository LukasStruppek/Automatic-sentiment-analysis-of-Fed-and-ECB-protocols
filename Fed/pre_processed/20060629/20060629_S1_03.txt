Gains in nonfarm private payrolls averaged 112,000 over the three months ending in May, a pace considerably below the average of about 170,000 jobs per month for the prior three-month period. The slowing in hiring was most pronounced in retail trade but was also evident in construction and information services. Establishments in professional and business services, nonbusiness services, and wholesale trade continued to add jobs at roughly the same pace as earlier in the year. Average hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls edged up in April but reversed these gains in May. The unemployment rate was 4.6 percent in May, near its average for the year so far.
