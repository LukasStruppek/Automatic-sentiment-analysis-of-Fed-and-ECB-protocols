The U.S. international trade deficit widened in April, reflecting a large increase in imports coupled with a slight decline in exports. Import growth was led by sharp rises in the value of imported oil and natural gas and increased imports of automotive products and capital goods. Exports were restrained in part by a decline in aircraft exports. Expansion of economic activity in the foreign industrial countries was solid in the first quarter, but indications for the second quarter were more mixed. Incoming data pointed to a possible slowing in Canada, but signs of further expansion in the euro area and of continued growth in Japan were evident, notwithstanding sharp declines in equity indexes in these countries.
