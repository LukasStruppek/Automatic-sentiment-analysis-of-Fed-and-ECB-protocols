Participants observed that many foreign central banks had tightened monetary policy over the intermeeting period in response to strengthening activity and indications of inflation pressures. Greater uncertainty about inflation pressures and the needed policy response had perhaps contributed to a reassessment of risks by investors globally. Despite the tighter policy, however, economic growth in the United States' major trading partners appeared likely to remain solid, supporting U.S. exports. Participants also discussed the role of global capacity utilization in the inflation process.
