Industrial production edged down in May after strong growth in April, largely reflecting the patterns of manufacturing output. For the year to date, manufacturing production advanced at a rate significantly below its rapid fourth-quarter growth rate but only a bit below its average pace of expansion since mid-2003. The mining sector, which includes oil and natural gas extraction, expanded solidly in April before falling back in May. Utilities output also grew strongly in April but retreated in May as temperatures returned to normal after having been unseasonably warm in April. Capacity utilization in manufacturing remained somewhat above its long-run average in both April and May.
