[' Members welcomed the generally favorable price and cost developments of recent months and the related indications that currently high levels of resource use did not appear to be associated with rising inflationary pressures. Many emphasized the persistence of subdued increases in labor costs, and a number provided supporting anecdotal indications of relatively small advances in labor compensation in many parts of the country despite tight labor markets. The anecdotal reports also continued to suggest that strong competition was holding down price inflation and that producers were benefiting from soft prices of industrial materials. While a number of members believed that these developments might augur a modest decline in inflation over the year ahead, given current forecasts of moderate economic expansion, many viewed as more likely the prospect of little or no progress toward price stability over coming quarters and some expressed concern about the potential for an upward drift in the rate of inflation. An underlying factor in the relatively favorable climate for inflation was the continued limited rise in the costs of worker benefits. In the view of some members, however, benefit costs were likely to be less well contained as time went on and further major gains in curbing such costs became more difficult to achieve. Moreover, worker willingness to accept relatively limited increases in wages and other compensation might well begin to erode as concerns about job security tended to diminish after an extended period of relatively low unemployment. On balance, recent experience had raised questions about the relationship between levels of resource use and inflation that warranted careful monitoring. ']
