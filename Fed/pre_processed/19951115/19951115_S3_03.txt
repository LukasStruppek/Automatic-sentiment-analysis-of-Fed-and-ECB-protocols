[' In their review of developments in key demand sectors of the economy, members observed that consumer spending appeared to be on a firm growth trend, though weakness in overall sales of motor vehicles in recent months and a decline in total retail sales in October had introduced a cautionary note. It was suggested that the performance of retail sales during the holiday season would tend to set the tone for the longer-term trend in such sales, and in this respect available data and anecdotal reports covering the first part of November were somewhat promising. More generally, further growth in consumer spending, though probably at a somewhat slower pace than over the past year, appeared likely. Such growth would be supported by moderate expansion in incomes and by the favorable effects on household wealth and confidence of the substantial improvement in the value of financial assets this year and the ready availability of financing on relatively attractive terms. Consumer confidence currently seemed to be at a fairly high level, albeit not uniformly so across the country, and at least for the quarters immediately ahead, anticipated strength in homebuilding should induce spending for many household durables. On the negative side, some members emphasized that the growth in consumer debt was likely to exert an increasingly inhibiting effect on consumer spending. Moreover, the satisfaction of earlier pent-up demands might well limit sales of many consumer durables, notably motor vehicles, in coming quarters. In one view, the projected growth in personal incomes and the increases that had occurred this year in the value of household holdings of financial assets would provide relatively little stimulus to consumer spending because the distribution of such gains was heavily tilted toward consumers in higher income or older age groups.
