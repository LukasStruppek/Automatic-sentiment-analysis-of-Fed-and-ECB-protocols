[" In the course of the Committee's discussion, members reported on uneven business conditions in different parts of the country and among industries. On balance, modest to moderate growth appeared to characterize most regions, with overall levels of activity ranging from relatively robust in some regions to comparatively depressed in others. The mixed conditions were especially notable in manufacturing where numerous producers faced lagging demands while others, particularly in high-tech industries, found it difficult to satisfy strong demands for their products. More generally, the industrial sector of the economy had tended to stagnate for some time, including a slight decline in manufacturing activity reported for October, but recent improvement in orders for steel was cited as a favorable if not decisive omen in the outlook for industrial production. In other sectors of the economy, members observed that tourism displayed considerable strength in many areas, while cattle operations and energy production were adversely affected by high production costs or low prices.
