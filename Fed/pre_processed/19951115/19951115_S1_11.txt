[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed markedly in August; for July and August-combined, the deficit was significantly smaller than its average rate in the second quarter. The value of exports declined over the two-month period, with increases in exports of computers and agricultural products more than offset by decreases in exports of aircraft, gold, and service receipts. Imports fell more than exports; with the notable exception of computers and semiconductors, declines were recorded in most major import categories. Available data indicated that economic expansion remained subdued in the major foreign industrial countries. Growth continued to slow in the European economies other than Italy, and the Japanese economy showed little evidence of a sustained recovery. ']
