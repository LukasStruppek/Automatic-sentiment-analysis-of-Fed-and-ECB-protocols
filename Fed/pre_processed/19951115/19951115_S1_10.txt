[' Available data suggested a reduction in business inventory accumulation in August and September. In manufacturing, the pace of stockbuilding slowed in the third quarter from the brisk rate of the first half of the year, leaving the factory stock-shipments ratio unchanged in the third quarter and a little above historic lows. In the wholesale sector, inventories were drawn down in August and September after sizable buildups in earlier months; with sales weak, the aggregate inventory-sales ratio for the sector edged up in the third quarter and was at the upper end of its range for recent years. Retail inventories expanded significantly in August (latest data available), but the stockbuilding was generally in line with sales and the ratio of inventories to sales remained near the middle of its range in recent years.
