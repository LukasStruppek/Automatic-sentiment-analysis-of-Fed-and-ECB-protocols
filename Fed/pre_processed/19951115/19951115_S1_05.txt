[' The information available at the time of the meeting was mixed, but on balance it suggested a more moderate rate of expansion of economic activity after a strong gain during the summer. Consumer spending had turned sluggish recently; but with order backlogs still large, business spending for durable equipment was continuing at a robust if somewhat less rapid rate, and the sizable rise in housing starts in the third quarter presaged higher residential construction outlays. Appreciable increases in employment and hours worked tended to confirm that the economy had continued to expand at a solid pace, although manufacturing activity had weakened a little. Consumer and producer prices had risen more slowly on average in recent months after having increased at elevated rates in the early part of the year, and growth in labor costs had slowed further. ']
