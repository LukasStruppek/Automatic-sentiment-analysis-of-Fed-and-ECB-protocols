[" In the Committee's discussion, members commented that recent statistical and anecdotal information pointed on balance to an appreciable slowing in the economic expansion, which had displayed unexpected strength during the summer months. There was some mix of views among the members concerning how far the slowing might proceed, though they generally viewed moderate growth as the most likely course for the economy. A number of members believed that growth around potential was a probable outcome, with business activity sustained in part by the favorable developments this year in the bond and stock markets. Other members expressed concern about some signs of further ebbing in the strength of final demands, and they envisaged the possible need for a policy adjustment at some point to sustain continued moderate growth. With regard to inflation, members noted that despite generally high levels of resource use, including tight labor markets in many parts of the country, inflation had been more subdued than many had expected over the past several months. A number of members commented that they saw a basis in this development for mild optimism about the outlook for inflation, but others expressed concern that, in the context of current forecasts for economic activity and relatively high levels of resource use, progress toward lower inflation was unlikely over the projection period and indeed there was a risk of some modest deterioration in price performance.
