The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity exhibited little, if any, upward movement in midsummer. Increases in household expenditures on consumer items and housing appeared to have been relatively well maintained, but business capital expenditures had weakened substantially since early in the year. Efforts to reduce inventories were continuing, and manufacturing activity had decreased further. Employment had declined over recent months. With energy prices having turned down, overall consumer price inflation had eased slightly in recent months, while core measures of consumer prices showed mixed changes on a twelve-month basis. Measures of labor costs had decelerated on balance.
