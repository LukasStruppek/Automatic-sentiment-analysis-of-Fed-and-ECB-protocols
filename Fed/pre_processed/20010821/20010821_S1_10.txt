The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed over the May-June period and was about $20 billion smaller at an annual rate in the second quarter than in the first. The value of imports dropped sharply in the second quarter. The value of exports also decreased significantly, with most of the decline in capital goods, primarily computers and semiconductors. Recent information on foreign industrial economies suggested that growth weakened further in the second quarter. The Japanese economy contracted in the quarter, and growth in the euro area appeared to have weakened substantially. Among the developing countries, economic and financial conditions had deteriorated further in Argentina. In most other developing countries, the pace of economic growth continued to decline.
