At its meeting on June 26-27, 2001, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with a decrease of 25 basis points in the intended level of the federal funds rate, to about 3Å¾ percent. This action was deemed appropriate in light of incoming information indicating somewhat weaker economic performance than most members had anticipated and the absence of firm evidence that the deceleration in the economic expansion had run its course or that output growth was about to rebound. With greater slack in labor and product markets and with inflation expectations contained, the members agreed that the balance of risks continued to be weighted toward conditions that could generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.
