The members generally viewed a modest decline in inflation as a reasonable prospect, at least for a while. Reports from around the nation indicated that labor market conditions had eased, though they remained generally tight and workers available to fill a variety of skilled job openings continued to be in short supply. On balance, however, upward pressures on labor compensation appeared to be easing somewhat despite large increases in the costs of medical care. Competitive pressures continued to make it very difficult for business firms to raise their prices and there were no signs that widespread discounting might be coming to an end. An apparent downtrend in the costs of energy was another favorable factor in the outlook for inflation. Some members expressed a degree of concern, however, about the longer-term outlook for inflation. Pressures on resources would rise as the anticipated upturn and possible above-trend growth brought the economy closer to full capacity utilization. An important uncertainty in this regard was the outlook for productivity, whose growth might have moderated from the unusually high growth rates of 1999 and 2000, with possibly adverse implications for labor costs at very low levels of unemployment.
