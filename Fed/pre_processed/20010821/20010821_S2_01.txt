The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, after a period of very slow growth associated in large part with very weak business fixed investment and to some extent with an inventory correction, the economic expansion would gradually regain strength over the forecast horizon and move back to a rate around the staff's current estimate of the growth of the economy's potential output. The period of sub-par expansion was expected to foster an appreciable easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation. Although substantial monetary easing had already been implemented and fiscal stimulus was in train, the forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would continue to be held back by the effects on household net worth of recent and possible future declines in stock market prices and by damped consumer and business sentiment in a weaker job market. With long-term trends in innovation holding up reasonably well, business fixed investment, notably outlays for equipment and software, likely would return to relatively robust growth after a period of adjustment of capital stocks to more desirable levels, and a projected pickup in foreign economies was seen as providing some support for U.S. exports.
