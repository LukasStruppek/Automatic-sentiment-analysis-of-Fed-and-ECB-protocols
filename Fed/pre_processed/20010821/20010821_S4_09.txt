On September 13, 2001, the Committee met by telephone conference to assess economic and financial developments stemming from the terrorist attacks on September 11 and the possible need for a monetary policy response. Banking and other financial market conditions, notably in New York City but also around the nation, were discussed in some detail as well as the outlook for reopening the stock exchanges. While the ongoing reactions to the recent tragedy were undoubtedly a negative factor in the economic outlook, the members agreed that financial markets were still too disrupted and the economic outlook too uncertain to provide an adequate basis for a policy move at this time. However, the members contemplated the need for some policy easing in the very near future. In the interim, the System would continue to stand ready to provide whatever liquidity might be needed to counter unusual strains and help assure the effective functioning of the banking system and restore more normal conditions in financial markets.
