In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal calling for a slight further easing in reserve conditions consistent with a 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate to a level of 3-1/2 percent. No member expressed a preference for leaving policy unchanged or easing by more than 25 basis points. The economy had continued to be weak--indeed, weaker than many had expected--and data and anecdotal reports from around the country had yet to point to persuasive signs of a turnaround. The monetary and fiscal policy stimulus already in train seemed adequate to promote and support an eventual appreciable rise in the growth of business activity to a pace near that of the economy's potential, but the strength and timing of the pickup remained uncertain and further weakness was a distinct threat in the nearer term. In particular, possible faltering in household expenditures at a time when business firms were still adjusting to inventory imbalances and to capital overinvestments would exacerbate the slowdown in the economy and delay its anticipated recovery. Growing concerns about foreign economies added to the current unease about potential near-term developments.
