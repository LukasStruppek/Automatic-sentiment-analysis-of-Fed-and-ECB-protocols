Private nonfarm payroll employment, after declining appreciably during the second quarter, fell further in July, led by additional job losses in manufacturing and help-supply services. Labor demand remained weak in other sectors, with employment in most industries flat to down. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.5 percent in June and remained at that level in July. Although initial claims for unemployment insurance had declined in recent weeks, on balance data suggested persisting softening in the labor market.
