Business inventory liquidation was sizable in the second quarter, at a pace estimated to be a bit more rapid than in the first quarter. Manufacturing stocks, particularly of computers and electronic products, were reduced substantially; however, shipments of those products also plunged and the inventory-sales ratio in the computer and electronics sector rose further from an already high level. Elsewhere in manufacturing, the ratio of stocks to sales held steady, with stocks remaining high in a number of manufacturing industries despite aggressive production cutbacks. Inventories rose in the wholesale sector and, given sluggish sales of late, the ratio of inventories to sales moved sharply higher in the second quarter. Stocks in the automobile sector declined over the quarter and moved lower in July. Retail inventories, excluding motor vehicles, fell moderately and the sector's inventory-sales ratio edged lower.
