Fiscal policy developments were a supportive factor in the economy. The tax rebates currently being distributed undoubtedly were having a limited but positive effect on consumers, which likely would continue over coming months. The impetus could not be measured precisely, but it was reflected in available anecdotal reports. Moreover, the reductions in income tax rates would have an ongoing effect in boosting disposable household incomes. On the negative side, financial difficulties in a number of states were being met in part through higher taxes that implied at least some offset to the federal tax relief.
