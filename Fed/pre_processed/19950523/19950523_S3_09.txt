[' Concerning inflation, several members commented that the rise in consumer prices and some other broad measures of inflation in recent months appeared to reflect cyclical developments relating to the tightening of resource and product markets over the past year, including the partial pass-through of sizable increases in prices at earlier stages of production. In addition, higher import prices might have been playing a role. A number of members expressed concern that, with the economy already producing at or even slightly above its sustainable potential, inflation pressures were likely to intensify if the current pause in the expansion were to be followed by a period of above-average growth. On the other hand, members who saw the odds as pointing to a more moderate rebound after a period of relatively sluggish economic performance were inclined to the view that an upward trend in inflation was likely to be averted. In addition, the ongoing competitive pressures in many markets, the restraint in compensation increases, and the continuing efforts to cut production costs would help to contain pressures on prices over time.
