[' Members commented that a reduction in the rate of inventory investment was likely to be the dominant influence on the near-term performance of the economy. Some also saw a risk that a significantly greater-than-expected softening in inventory accumulation might have adverse, and possibly cumulative, effects of a longer-term nature on production and incomes and thus on consumer and business spending. With the exception of the motor vehicle industry, however, current inventory levels generally were quite low in relation to sales and potential inventory adjustments were likely to be limited in size. Once further inventory adjustments were completed, the rate of accumulation could be expected to remain well below the unsustainable pace experienced over the past year and perhaps settle into a pattern where changes in inventories became a relatively neutral factor in the ongoing economic expansion.
