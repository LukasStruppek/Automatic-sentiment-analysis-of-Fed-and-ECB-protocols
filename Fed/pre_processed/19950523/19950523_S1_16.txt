[" In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined substantially further over the first half of the intermeeting period. In mid-April, the dollar reached a record low against the Japanese yen and approached a record low against the German mark. The dollar's weakness appeared to have been related in part to further indications of softening economic activity and related declines in interest rates in the United States and to increasing trade tensions with Japan. Late in the period, the dollar reversed its course and moved up sharply against the yen and the mark; monetary easing abroad, improving prospects for reductions in the U.S. budget deficit, and stabilizing financial conditions in Mexico appeared to contribute to the turnaround. The dollar ended the intermeeting period higher on balance against the other G-10 currencies. "]
