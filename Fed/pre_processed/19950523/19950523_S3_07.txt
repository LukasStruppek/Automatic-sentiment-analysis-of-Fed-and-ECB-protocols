[' The foreign trade sector likewise was expected to make an appreciable contribution to the expansion of economic activity in coming quarters. The robust uptrend in U.S. exports during 1994 had been slowed to a considerable extent thus far this year by the sharp adjustment in trade with Mexico, but in the view of several members that adjustment might now be largely completed. In that event, gains in exports could be expected to resume at a fairly brisk pace despite indications of reduced economic growth in some key foreign countries. This assessment was supported by anecdotal reports of rising foreign demand for some U.S. products in the context of the generally improved international competitive position of the United States. Concurrently, growth in imports would tend to be held down by the projected slowing in the expansion of domestic demand. On the negative side, some members referred to the possibility that a longer period might be needed to resolve the difficulties being experienced by Mexico, and several expressed particular concern about the potential for relatively severe disruptions to trade if current negotiations with Japan were not successfully concluded.
