[' Inflation had picked up somewhat in the early months of 1995. At the consumer level, prices rose a little more rapidly in the first quarter, despite unchanged food prices and lower energy prices. In April, a surge in food prices and a rebound in energy prices contributed to a further step-up in consumer inflation. At the producer level, prices of finished goods followed a roughly similar pattern, increasing at a slightly faster pace in the first quarter and then more briskly in April. The April rise partly reflected a sharp jump in the prices of finished energy goods, but prices of non-energy, nonfood items also advanced at a somewhat faster rate. At earlier stages of production, prices of intermediate materials continued to increase rapidly in April. By contrast, trends in labor compensation costs remained subdued. Gains in hourly compensation of private industry workers slowed further in the first quarter of 1995, with a continuing moderation in the cost of benefits accounting for all of the deceleration in compensation.
