[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity had slowed considerably further and that rates of resource utilization had declined. Although business investment in equipment and structures had remained strong, overall final sales had expanded less rapidly and inventories had continued to build. Manufacturing output appeared to be down appreciably, in large measure reflecting cutbacks in motor vehicle production, and the slump in housing starts since the turn of the year was depressing construction activity. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices had increased a little faster thus far this year, while advances in labor compensation costs had remained subdued. ']
