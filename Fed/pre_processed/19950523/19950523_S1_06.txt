[' Nonfarm payroll employment posted reduced gains in the first quarter and changed little in April; special factors and seasonal adjustment difficulties may have depressed reported job growth in April. Hiring in service-producing industries was down sharply from the pace in previous months, with jobs in personnel supply services falling for a second consecutive month after three years of rapid growth.

Initial claims for unemployment insurance increased considerably in recent weeks, and the civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.8 percent in April. ']
