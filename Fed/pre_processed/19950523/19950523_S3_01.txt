[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members reported on statistical and anecdotal indications of further slowing in the expansion of economic activity and some related easing of pressures on labor and other producer resources. A number commented that they anticipated a relatively sluggish economic performance over coming months as production was cut back to bring inventories into better balance with sales. However, underlying demand was likely to remain sufficiently robust, especially in light of developments in financial markets, to avert a cumulative decline in business activity and, indeed, to return economic growth to a pace broadly in line with potential. Members cited in particular the strength in business fixed investment and the potential for improvement in housing activity and the trade balance as factors that should help to sustain the expansion. Nonetheless, the longer-run outlook remained subject to considerable uncertainty, especially given the undecided course of fiscal policy and the ongoing inventory correction; the ultimate extent of that correction and its effects on overall economic performance were subject to a cyclical dynamic whose outcome could not be predicted with confidence. A worsening in key measures of inflation, including the consumer price index and the producer price index for finished goods, was a disappointing--if not unexpected--development. A number of members expressed concern that the risks were still tilted in the direction of some further step-up in inflation; however, others were more inclined to the view that inflation was not likely to rise much further in a climate of moderate growth in demand, intense competitive pressures in many markets, and relatively subdued increases in labor costs.
