[' Most market interest rates moved lower over the intermeeting period in reaction to weaker-than-expected incoming economic data, which market participants interpreted as signaling a considerable slowing of the economic expansion and a growing likelihood that the next monetary policy move would be in an easing direction. Market assessments that the prospects for major reductions in budget deficits were improving also seemed to contribute to the drop in rates. In this environment, the release of data indicating large increases in consumer and producer prices for April only temporarily interrupted the decline in rates. Intermediate- and long-term interest rates posted the largest declines over the intermeeting period. ']
