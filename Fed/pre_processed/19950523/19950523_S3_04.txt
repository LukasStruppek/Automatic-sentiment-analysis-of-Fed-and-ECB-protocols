[' With regard to developments in key sectors of the economy, the slowdown in the growth of consumer spending was somewhat more pronounced than anticipated earlier. Some rebound in consumer demand seemed likely and already appeared to be occurring in the motor vehicle industry in May. Underlying conditions for further growth in consumer spending were viewed as relatively favorable; these conditions included strengthened balance sheets stemming from developments in financial markets, continued growth of incomes, and aggressive extensions of consumer credit by a number of lenders. In at least one view, however, consumer credit had been growing at a pace that could not be sustained and the inevitable correction could coincide with and exacerbate emerging weakness in consumer demand. On balance, growth in personal consumption expenditures was seen as likely to continue over coming quarters but at a reduced pace given the apparent satisfaction of a large portion of earlier pent-up demands for consumer durables and some expected moderation in the growth of jobs and incomes.
