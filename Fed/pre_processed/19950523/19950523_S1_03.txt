[' The Manager requested a temporary increase of $2 billion, to $10 billion, in the limit on intermeeting changes in outright System Account holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities. He advised the Committee that the current leeway of $8 billion might not be sufficient to accommodate the potentially large need for additional reserves over the intermeeting period to meet an anticipated seasonal rise in the domestic demand for currency as well as continued currency outflows to foreign countries. By unanimous vote, the Committee amended paragraph 1(a) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations to raise the limit to $10 billion for the intermeeting period ending with the close of business on July 5, 1995.
