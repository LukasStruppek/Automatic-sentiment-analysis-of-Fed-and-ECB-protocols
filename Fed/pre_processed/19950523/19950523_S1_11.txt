[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was little changed in March from the February level and remained substantially narrower than in January. On a quarterly average basis, the trade deficit widened in the first quarter as growth in the value of exports slowed while the expansion in the value of imports continued unabated. A drop in shipments to Mexico was among the factors holding down export growth in March. Data available for the first quarter indicated that economic recovery continued in the major foreign industrial countries as a group but that the pace varied significantly across countries. There were signs of sustained growth in the United Kingdom, slower growth in Canada, renewed recovery in Japan, and weakness in France and Italy. ']
