The implications of continued robust growth for the inflation outlook depended critically on judgments about the supply side of the economy. Productivity and economic potential seemed to have been growing at an increasingly rapid rate in recent years. That acceleration had itself tended to boost consumption and investment demand--in complex interactions of aggregate supply and demand--but it also had held down increases in unit costs and prices. A great deal of uncertainty surrounded the behavior of productivity growth going forward, but some further pickup, and the associated ability of the economy to accommodate more rapid growth without added inflation, was a possibility that could not be overlooked. However, a further pickup in productivity growth was by no means assured, and a number of other favorable developments in supply and prices that had acted to restrain inflation in recent years had already begun to dissipate or reverse. These included the substantial upturn in energy prices, the ebbing of import price declines, and the pickup in health care costs; adverse trends in the latter two factors in particular were likely to be extended. In these circumstances, members generally saw some risk of rising inflation going forward, but they also recognized that similar forecasts in recent years had proved wrong and that considerable uncertainty surrounded expectations of somewhat higher core inflation.
