Open market operations after the meeting were directed toward implementing and maintaining the desired slight tightening of pressure on reserve positions, and the federal funds rate averaged very close to the Committee's 5-1/4 percent target. Most other short-term market interest rates posted small mixed changes on balance, because the policy action was widely anticipated and the FOMC's policy announcement after the August 24 meeting referenced markedly diminished inflation risks. However, longer-term yields rose somewhat over the intermeeting period in response to the receipt of new information indicating both surprisingly strong spending at home and abroad and higher commodity prices. Most measures of share prices in equity markets registered sizable declines over the intermeeting period, apparently reflecting not only higher interest rates but also concerns that U.S. stocks might be overvalued and that foreign equities were becoming relatively more attractive as economic prospects brightened abroad.
