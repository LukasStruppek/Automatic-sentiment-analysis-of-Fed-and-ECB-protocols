Other factors cited as pointing to a less benign inflation performance involved the waning or reversal of a number of temporary influences that had exerted a beneficial effect on prices in recent years. In particular, the decline of the dollar from its recent high in July, especially if it were to continue, would mean higher import prices and reduced price competition for a wide range of domestic goods. In this regard, several members observed that they were hearing noticeably fewer comments by business contacts about their inability to raise prices. Members also noted that, in the context of apparently strengthening economic activity worldwide, non-oil commodity prices seemed poised to turn upward, though they had risen only slightly thus far. While oil prices, which had increased sharply this year, had changed relatively little recently and could move down in the future, secondary effects of the earlier increase on costs and prices in other sectors of the economy seemed likely. Nonetheless, considerable uncertainty surrounded expectations of rising inflation. Labor cost increases had not turned up and core inflation continued to edge lower. Further improvements in productivity growth could keep price pressures in check for some time.
