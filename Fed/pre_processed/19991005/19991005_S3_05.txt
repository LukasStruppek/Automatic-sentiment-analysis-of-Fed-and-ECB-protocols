Business fixed investment appeared to have accelerated to a surprising extent in the third quarter from an already robust pace earlier in the year. Further noteworthy gains were recorded in business expenditures for computing and communications equipment, evidently reflecting ongoing efforts to take advantage of declining prices and improving technology. Some of the rise in such spending could represent accelerated purchases in advance of the century date change and might well tend to be offset in early 2000. Over time, however, ongoing efforts to enhance productivity for competitive reasons suggested further vigorous growth in spending for such equipment. Forecasts of other business investment expenditures were much less ebullient and on the whole pointed to little change. Building activity currently displayed substantial strength in some major cities, largely involving office and hotel structures, but nonresidential construction activity more generally was relatively sluggish. It seemed likely that commercial building activity would be damped later as new capacity was completed and financing became less attractive in response to the rise that had occurred in market interest rates.
