In the Committee's discussion of the outlook for inflation, a number of members emphasized that the behavior of prices had remained surprisingly benign for an extended period, confounding earlier forecasts of appreciable acceleration stemming from tight labor markets and rising labor costs. That experience argued forcefully in their view for the need to regard forecasts of increasing inflation with considerable caution. Most members nonetheless continued to view some increase in core price inflation as a definite possibility. This view reflected their expectations that the current expansion, even if it did moderate to a pace approximating the economy's trend potential growth, would do so at a level of resource use that based on the historical record exceeded the economy's sustainable capacity--perhaps by even more than at present, given the evident strength of aggregate demand. Such an outcome seemed likely to generate further pressures on unit labor costs, which had tended in recent years to be contained by accelerating productivity. There was no evidence that the acceleration was coming to an end, but the members saw a clear risk that upward pressures on labor costs could at some point outpace gains in productivity. Members also mentioned that labor compensation would come under greater pressures as a result of rising healthcare benefit costs and possible increases in the minimum wage.
