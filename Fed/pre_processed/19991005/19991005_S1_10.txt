The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in July from its second-quarter average, with the value of imports rising by more than the value of exports. The increase in imports was concentrated in aircraft, consumer goods, industrial supplies, and oil. The step-up in exports occurred primarily in industrial machinery and semiconductors. Among the major foreign industrial countries, the limited available information suggested that economic activity was strengthening in Europe and the United Kingdom in the third quarter while economic indicators for Japan were mixed after the strong advance in the first half of the year. Economic growth in Canada seemed to be continuing at a robust pace, and economic recovery in most of the Asian emerging-market economies was proceeding briskly.
