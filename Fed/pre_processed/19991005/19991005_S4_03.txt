With regard to the Committee's announcement of its decision to adopt an asymmetric directive, members observed that the recent practice of making such announcements had led to some misinterpretations of the Committee's intentions and seemed to have added to volatility in financial markets. As a consequence, Committee members briefly considered alternative treatments of symmetry and disclosure for this meeting. Because the Committee had begun a process for examining the wording of its directive and its announcement policy, most of the members concluded that the most satisfactory alternative for now, though it was not fully satisfactory, was to continue with the Committee's recent announcement practice. However, the working group chaired by Governor Ferguson was requested to expedite its report, if possible.
