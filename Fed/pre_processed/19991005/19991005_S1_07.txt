Total retail sales posted strong gains over July and August. Increases in sales were spread across all major categories, with spending for nondurable goods and motor vehicles notably strong. Expenditures on services rose moderately in the two-month period. There were mixed signals with regard to the housing sector. Construction was at a high level, the inventory of unsold homes remained quite low, and starts of multifamily units rose over the July-August period. However, single-family housing starts edged lower on balance over July and August, and sales of existing homes weakened.
