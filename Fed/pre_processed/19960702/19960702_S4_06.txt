Inflation expectations persisted in financial markets, and probably in product and labor markets as well; if they were allowed to worsen, the Committee's long-run goal of price stability would become much more difficult to achieve. Delaying action risked the need for a greater adjustment in policy at a later date with possible disruption to the economy. "]
