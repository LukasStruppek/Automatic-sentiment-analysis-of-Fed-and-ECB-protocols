[" Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period. The federal funds rate averaged near 5-1/4 percent, the level expected to be associated with the unchanged policy stance. Because the Committee's decision had been largely anticipated in financial markets, other market interest rates also were little changed during the early part of the period.

On balance, most market rates were up a little over the intermeeting period. Major indexes of stock prices were down on balance over the period. "]
