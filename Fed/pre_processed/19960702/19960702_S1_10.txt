[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in April from its rate in the first quarter, reflecting a slightly larger increase in the value of imports than in that of exports. The expansion in imports was concentrated in oil as U.S. refiners sought to meet growing domestic demand and rebuild their inventories. The rise in exports was broadly based, although exports of computers, semiconductors, and automotive products edged off. Economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries appeared to have expanded moderately on balance since the beginning of the year. In the first quarter, economic performance ranged from unexpectedly robust in Japan to further weakness in Germany; the limited data available for the second quarter suggested a slowdown in Japan, a bounceback in Germany, and moderate growth in other major trading partners. Although upward pressures on energy prices continued to boost overall consumer prices in April and May, price increases for nonfood, non-energy items remained small. Over the twelve months ended in May, the increase in core consumer prices was appreciably smaller than in the previous twelve-month period; much of the deceleration reflected swings in automobile finance charges. At the producer level, higher prices for finished energy goods over April and May were partially offset by slightly lower prices for finished foods; prices for nonfood, non-energy finished goods were little changed over the two-month period and rose less over the twelve months ended in May than in the comparable year-earlier period. Data on average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers indicated that this measure of labor costs had increased by a somewhat larger amount in the year ended in May than in the comparable year-earlier period.
