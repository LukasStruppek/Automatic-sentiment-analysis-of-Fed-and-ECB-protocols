[' Members observed that an asymmetric directive would represent a shift from the symmetric directives that had been adopted over the past year but would be in keeping with their assessments of the risks of higher inflation. Several commented that an asymmetric directive did not imply a commitment to tighten monetary policy at some point, whether during the intermeeting period or at a future meeting, but it did imply the need for special vigilance. Some noted that a policy tightening action could tend to have a more pronounced effect than usual because it would indicate a shift in the direction of policy and might generate expectations of further tightening. Under the circumstances, the Committee would consult in some way before any policy tightening was undertaken. ']
