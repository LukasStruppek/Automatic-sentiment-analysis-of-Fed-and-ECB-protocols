[' With regard to inflation over the long run, the members agreed that it was essential for the Committee to continue to focus on reducing inflation over time because the achievement of an even less inflationary economic environment would foster a more productive economy and maximum sustainable economic expansion. The members acknowledged that as inflation diminished to very low levels, questions about the measurement of the overall price level presented difficult problems for assessing progress toward price stability. Some also observed that the precise level of average price inflation that might be compatible with the optimal functioning of the economy was an unsettled issue owing, for example, to potential rigidities in labor markets. Thus far, such rigidities had not impeded the economy from functioning at a very high level as inflation came down, and continued adaptation to even lower inflation rates was very likely. However, the Committee would need to pay careful attention to these potential problems as inflation fell further. For now, the members agreed that some additional progress in reducing inflation was very likely to improve the ultimate performance of the economy, and that it was particularly important at this juncture to resist firmly any tendency for inflation to worsen.
