[' In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates in 1997 that it had established on a tentative basis at its meeting in July 1996. Those ranges included expansion of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 3 to 7 percent for 1997. The tentative ranges for 1997 were unchanged from the actual ranges adopted for 1995 (in July of that year for M3) and 1996. ']
