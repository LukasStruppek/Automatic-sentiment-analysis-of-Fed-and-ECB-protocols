[' The greater measure of predictability in velocity recently was an encouraging development, but in view of the substantial changes in financial markets and the increased availability of investment alternatives it would be premature to assume that the pattern would necessarily continue going forward. Given the substantial uncertainty still attached to projections of money growth consistent with the Committees basic objectives for monetary policy, the members agreed that there was no firm basis for changing the tentative ranges set in July 1996. Adopting higher ranges, which would be more closely centered on money growth thought likely to be consistent with the Committees expectations for economic activity and prices, could be misinterpreted as indicating that the Committee had become much more confident of the predictability of velocity and was placing greater emphasis on M2 and M3 as gauges of the thrust of monetary policy. One member, while agreeing with this assessment, emphasized that a continuation of a stable and predictable pattern of velocity behavior would raise the question as to whether the Committee should return to setting ranges consistent with its expectations for economic developments. Nonetheless, from a longer-run perspective, the tentative ranges readily encompass rates of growth of M2 and M3 that, if velocity were to behave in line with historical experience, could be expected to be associated with approximate price stability and a sustainable rate of real economic growth. In that regard, they continue to serve the useful purpose of benchmarking money growth consistent with the Committees long-run goal of price stability. ']
