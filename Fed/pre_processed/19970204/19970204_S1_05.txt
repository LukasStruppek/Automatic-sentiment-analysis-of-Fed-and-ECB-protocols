[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the growth of the economy had strengthened markedly in the fourth quarter of 1996. To a large extent the gain in final demand during the quarter reflected a surge in exports, but consumer spending also increased substantially after having risen at a much reduced pace in the third quarter. Despite some slowing in the growth of business fixed investment and some easing in housing activity, the overall economy had expanded briskly as reflected in data on production and employment. The tightness in labor markets had persisted and was evidenced by some continued acceleration in labor compensation in the fourth quarter. There was no discernible change in the underlying trend in price inflation, although a spurt in energy prices had resulted in faster increases in overall consumer and producer prices than in the third quarter.
