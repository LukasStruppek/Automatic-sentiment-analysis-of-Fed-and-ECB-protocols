[' Recent data pointed to little change in underlying inflation trends. Overall consumer prices had continued under upward pressure in November and December, boosted by large advances in energy prices. Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices rose modestly over the two months and increased less over the twelve months ending in December than over the previous twelve months. At the producer level, a similar pattern prevailed in prices of finished goods, and there was no evidence of increased price pressures at earlier stages of production. Worker compensation as measured by the employment cost index (ECI) and average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers rose considerably further during the closing months of 1996. For the year, both measures were up appreciably more than in 1995, though much of the acceleration in the ECI occurred in the first half of the year. ']
