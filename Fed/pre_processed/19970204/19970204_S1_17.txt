[" After growing at a considerably faster rate in the fourth quarter, M2 and M3 apparently increased at a more moderate but still brisk pace in January. The expansion of both aggregates likely was boosted by strong income growth, and the relatively rapid expansion of M3 reflected heavy bank reliance on the managed liabilities in M3 to fund robust loan growth. From the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996, M2 was estimated to have grown at a rate near the upper end of the Committee's annual range and M3 at a rate appreciably above the top of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had expanded moderately on balance over recent months and was estimated to have grown last year at a rate near the midpoint of its range. "]
