[' While the absence of increasing price inflation was a welcome development, members were concerned that the break with historical patterns might not persist. If labor markets remained under pressure, nominal compensation costs were likely to pick up at some point as one-time savings in worker benefit costs ran out and as workers became less willing to trade off lower wages for increased security; such a development would foster increases in labor costs that ultimately would feed through to higher prices. The members did not anticipate a sudden surge in inflation, but many expressed concern about the possibility of a gradual upcreep in coming quarters that might become more considerable later. They generally expected a small decline in overall price inflation this year, reflecting favorable developments in food and energy and, for the CPI, further technical improvements by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; however, they believed that the risks to their forecasts were in the direction of greater inflation and several noted in particular that projected declines in energy prices might not materialize as soon or to the extent assumed in many forecasts.
