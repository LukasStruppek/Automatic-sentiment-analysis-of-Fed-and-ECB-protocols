[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed considerably in October and November from its rate in the third quarter. Nearly all the improvement was accounted for by a very large increase in exports of goods and services. The rise was spread among all major trade categories except for automotive products. Economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries appeared to have continued to expand at a moderate rate on average in the fourth quarter. Available indicators suggested relatively strong economic performances in Japan, Canada, and the United Kingdom and slower growth in the major continental European countries. Further expansion was reported for several large Latin American and some Asian economies. ']
