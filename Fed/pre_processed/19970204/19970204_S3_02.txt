[" In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee establishes its long-run ranges for the growth of money and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had provided individual projections of the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the year 1997. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP had a central tendency of 2 to 2-1/4 percent and a full range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent. The projections of the civilian unemployment rate associated with these growth expectations were all in a range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for the fourth quarter of the year. With regard to nominal GDP growth in 1997, the forecasts were mainly in a range of 4-1/4 to 4-3/4 percent, with an overall range of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 percent. Nearly all the members anticipated a small decline in the rate of inflation in 1997, as measured by the consumer price index, from that recorded in 1996. Specifically, the projections converged on rates of 2-3/4 to 3 percent and a full range of 2-3/4 to 3-1/2 percent in 1997. These forecasts took account of expected developments in the food and energy sectors and further technical improvements in the index by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, both of which were expected to trim the reported rate. The projections were based on individual views concerning what would be an appropriate policy over the projection horizon to further progress toward the Committee's goals. "]
