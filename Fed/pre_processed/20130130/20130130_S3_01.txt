 In their discussion of the economic situation, meeting participants indicated that they viewed the information received during the intermeeting period as suggesting that, apart from some temporary factors that had led to a pause in overall output growth in recent months, the economy remained on a moderate growth path In particular, participants saw the economic outlook as little changed or modestly improved relative to the December meeting Most participants judged that there had been some reduction in downside risks facing the economy: Strains in global financial markets had eased somewhat, and US fiscal policymakers had come to a partial resolution of the so-called fiscal cliff Supported by a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the housing sector was strengthening, and the unemployment rate appeared likely to continue its gradual decline Nearly all participants anticipated that inflation over the medium-term would run at or below the Committee's 2 percent objective
