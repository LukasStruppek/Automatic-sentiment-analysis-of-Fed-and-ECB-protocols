[" Members remarked that uncertainties about remaining margins of slack in the economy, accentuated by the change in the household employment survey, and about potential levels of economic activity over the quarters ahead made it particularly difficult to assess the outlook for inflation. However, based on what seemed to be reasonable estimates of resource utilization levels and their own projections that the rate of economic growth would slow to a pace nearer the economy's growth potential, the members generally concluded that the rate of inflation, as measured by the CPI, might remain about unchanged or tilt slightly higher over the forecast horizon. This conclusion took into account the effects of the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, the increase in oil prices on world markets, and the at-least-temporary rise in food prices. Some members observed that the overall behavior of prices had been somewhat more favorable than they would have predicted, given the strength of the expansion and the level of resource utilization. One explanation could be that increases in overall capacity and productivity stemming from business restructuring activities and investments in new equipment and facilities had been greater than expected. Comments from numerous business contacts around the country continued to indicate that despite the rising costs of many materials used in the production process, highly competitive markets rendered it very difficult or impossible to pass these higher costs through to prices of finished goods. At the same time, labor compensation increases had remained subdued despite indications of shortages of some types of labor in many parts of the country. Exceptions involving sizable wage increases continued to be cited for some industries, such as construction and trucking, that were operating at full capacity. Nonetheless, in the absence of an uptrend thus far in consumer price inflation and given continuing uncertainties about job prospects despite large job gains, wage pressures had remained restrained.
