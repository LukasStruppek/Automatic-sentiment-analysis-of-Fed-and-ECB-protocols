[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, most members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. The economy seemed to be slowing, although to an uncertain extent. Earlier policy tightening actions were being reflected in the sluggish behavior of money and reserves, although the extent of their effects on spending were still in question. Inflation was a concern, but direct evidence of additional pressures on costs and prices was quite fragmentary. In these circumstances, all but one of the members concluded that it would be prudent for the Committee to assess further developments before taking any action. One member believed that prompt further tightening was needed to avert the development of greater inflation. "]
