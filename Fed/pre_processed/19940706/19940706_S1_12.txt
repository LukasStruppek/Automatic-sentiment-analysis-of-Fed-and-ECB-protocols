[' Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices had risen moderately through the first five months of the year. In May, the rise in the overall index of consumer prices continued to be held down by declines in energy prices. Excluding the food and energy components, the increase in consumer prices in the twelve months ending in May was smaller than that for the previous twelve months. Producer prices of finished goods continued to edge lower in May, reflecting further declines in prices of finished foods and energy goods. Producer prices for items other than food and energy increased at a faster rate in May, but the change over the twelve-month period ending in May was very small. At an earlier stage of processing, producer prices of crude materials other than food and energy registered another small decline in May, although the index was substantially higher in May than a year ago. Furthermore, prices of many basic industrial materials had remained under upward pressure. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased by a larger amount in May than in April, but the rise over the twelve months ended in May was about the same as in the previous twelve months.
