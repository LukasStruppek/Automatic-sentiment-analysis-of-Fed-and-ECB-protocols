[' Business fixed investment was thought likely to continue to provide appreciable stimulus to the expansion, though to a diminishing extent in the context of slower overall growth in economic activity and higher financing costs. While spending for equipment was likely to moderate considerably from the extraordinarily rapid increases recorded over an extended period, ongoing business efforts to improve operating efficiencies would probably sustain substantial further growth in equipment outlays. Nonresidential construction expenditures were expected to post moderate increases after stagnating earlier; in this connection, a number of members observed that commercial vacancy rates were declining in various metropolitan areas and improved demand for space was likely to generate increased construction activity. Although higher interest costs could have some restraining effect, financing for such projects was more readily available than earlier. The outlook for inventory investment remained uncertain. Some buildup in inventories was occurring, but business firms were continuing to resist sizable increases and inventory-to-sales ratios remained at unusually low levels. Developments that might be expected to foster a faster buildup, such as some lengthening of order lead times and rising pressures on capacity in some industries, had not led to the strengthening in inventory investment that had characterized comparable stages of previous business cycle expansions.
