[' Immediately after the conclusion of the May meeting, the Board of Governors approved a 1/2 percentage point increase in the discount rate, to 3-1/2 percent, and the Committee permitted the full amount of the increase to pass through to interest rates in reserve markets. Thereafter, open market operations were conducted with a view to maintaining the less accommodative degree of reserve pressure sought by the Committee. After the policy change, the federal funds rate rose 1/2 percentage point, to 4-1/4 percent, and remained at about that level over the intermeeting period. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing trended higher over the intermeeting period, reflecting the usual seasonal pickup in lending activity, and averaged close to anticipated levels. ']
