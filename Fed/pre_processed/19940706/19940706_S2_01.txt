[" The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy was operating at a level close to capacity and that the expansion would slow over the next several quarters to a rate generally in line with the growth of the economy's potential. To the extent that aggregate demand tended to expand at a pace that could foster higher inflation, it would not be accommodated by monetary policy, and pressures would be generated in financial markets that would restrain domestic spending. Consumer spending, which had been increasing faster than household income for some time, was expected to moderate as smaller gains in employment and income, coupled with higher interest rates and reductions in the value of household financial assets, exerted a restraining influence on consumption patterns. Business fixed investment was projected to continue at a brisk pace, although growth would be damped somewhat by the expected deceleration in economic activity, a growing shortfall of corporate cash flow relative to capital outlays, and higher financing costs. The effects of higher mortgage interest rates were expected to cause some slowing in the relatively robust pace of single-family homebuilding. The restraint on output growth exerted by weak export demand was expected to diminish because of the lower value of the dollar and the somewhat faster recovery now projected in economic activity abroad. The staff analysis suggested that, with the economy already operating close to its long-run potential, no further reduction in the core rate of inflation was likely over the forecast horizon. "]
