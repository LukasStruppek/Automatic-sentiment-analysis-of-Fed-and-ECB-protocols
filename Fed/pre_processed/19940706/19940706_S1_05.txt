[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity recorded another substantial gain in the second quarter. Although consumer spending and homebuying apparently had increased at a slower pace, business spending on durable equipment remained quite strong and investment in nonresidential structures rebounded from a weather-depressed level in the first quarter. In addition, the rate of nonfarm inventory investment evidently had picked up in the second quarter. Levels of resource utilization had risen further: factory operating rates were at relatively high levels, and the slack in labor markets had narrowed considerably over the first half of the year to what appeared to be very low levels. Increases in consumer and producer prices had remained moderate in recent months, but prices of many basic industrial materials had risen. ']
