[' The rise in industrial production slackened in April and May after strong first-quarter gains. Much of the slowing was the result of capacity constraints that prevented normal seasonal increases in the production of motor vehicles. Growth of output of manufactured goods other than motor vehicles and parts was at a slightly less robust pace than in the first quarter but close to the rapid rate seen in 1993; business equipment and construction supplies continued to be areas of strength. The overall rate of utilization in manufacturing stayed at a high level in May, with most major industry groups operating at or near capacity. In addition to motor vehicles, capacity constraints were evident in the petroleum products and nonelectrical machinery industry groups and in some individual product lines in other industries. ']
