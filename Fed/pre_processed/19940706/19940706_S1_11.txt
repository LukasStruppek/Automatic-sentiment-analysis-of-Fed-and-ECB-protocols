[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in April but was little changed from the average for the first quarter; over the first four months of 1994, the deficit was significantly larger than that recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. The value of exports of goods and services was down somewhat in April, retracing part of a sharp runup in March. The uptrend in exports since last fall has been led by shipments of machinery, especially to expanding markets in Asia. The value of imports of goods and services was about the same in April as in March; increases in consumer goods, machinery, and oil were offset by declines in other categories. The economies of all the major foreign industrial countries expanded in the first quarter of 1994. Growth resumed in Japan, western Germany, and France, while economic expansion continued at a healthy pace in the United Kingdom and Canada. ']
