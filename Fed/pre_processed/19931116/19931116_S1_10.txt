[' Business inventories climbed significantly further in September; for the third quarter as a whole, however, stocks were accumulated at a somewhat slower pace than in the first half of the year. At the retail level, inventories rebounded in September after declining on balance over July and August. The ratio of inventories to sales for retailing edged up in September but remained near the low end of its range over the past year. Inventory accumulation in the wholesale sector slowed in September after rising substantially in August: the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector was unchanged at the midpoint of its range over the past several years. In manufacturing, stocks dropped in September after changing little over the two previous months; with factory shipments up, the stocks-to-shipments ratio for manufacturing as whole fell in September to its lowest level in recent years.
