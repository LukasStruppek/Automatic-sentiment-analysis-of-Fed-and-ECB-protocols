[' The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity, after advancing relatively strongly in the fourth quarter, would expand moderately next year, about in line with the potential rate of economic growth over time, and thus would be associated with limited, if any, further reductions in margins of unemployed labor and capital. Consumer spending, which had buoyed growth recently, was expected to expand at the same pace as incomes over the year ahead. In addition, fiscal restraint and uncertainty about other government policies would continue to inhibit the expansion, and a sluggish acceleration in foreign industrial economies pointed to only modest improvement in export demand. However, improving balance-sheet positions and credit supply conditions were lifting an unusual constraint on spending, and the lower interest rates would encourage further increases in business fixed investment and housing construction. The continued slack in labor and product markets, coupled with some tempering of inflation expectations, was expected to foster further reductions in wage and price inflation. ']
