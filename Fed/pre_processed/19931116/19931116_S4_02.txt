[' With regard to financial developments bearing on the economic outlook and the potential need to adjust monetary policy, members observed that the broader money and credit aggregates had strengthened somewhat since earlier in the year, though to still relatively moderate growth rates. Moreover, much of the acceleration in M2 and M3 could be attributed to special or temporary factors, and according to a staff analysis growth in these aggregates was likely to revert to relatively slow rates in coming months, assuming unchanged reserve conditions. At the same time, growth in M1 and reserves had remained comparatively rapid and in one view such growth might well be indicative of an overly stimulative monetary policy that would promote more inflation over time or at least prove inconsistent with further disinflation.
