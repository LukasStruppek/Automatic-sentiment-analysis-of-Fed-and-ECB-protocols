[" In the course of the Committee's discussion, members observed that the purpose of the transcripts had been to assist the FOMC Secretariat in the preparation of minutes that reported the economic and monetary policy discussions and were released after the next meeting. As a result, the transcripts for past meetings had never been edited nor had they been checked by meeting participants for accuracy. It was clear from even a casual perusal that at times the transcripts failed for various reasons to convey an intelligible account of members' comments, and on occasion they even misstated the views that had been expressed. Moreover, most participants at these meetings had not been aware until recently that the transcripts had been preserved and that they could at some point be made public. Their release at this time would represent a sharp break with past practice and would raise an issue of fairness to participants at earlier meetings of the Committee. "]
