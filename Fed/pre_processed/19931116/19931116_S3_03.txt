[" With regard to the outlook for specific sectors of the economy, a step-up in consumer spending, notably for motor vehicles and housing-related durable goods, had contributed substantially to the strengthening of the economic expansion. Indications of improving consumer confidence, reflected in turn in the growing optimism expressed by business contacts regarding the outlook for holiday sales, should help to sustain relatively ebullient consumer spending through the year-end. Contacts in the motor vehicles industry also appeared to be relatively optimistic about the prospects for sales of the new models. The outlook for the consumer sector also was subject to some constraining influences. Growth in consumer spending had tended to exceed the expansion in consumer incomes and a number of members questioned the extent to which the acceleration in such spending was likely to extend into the new year. The saving rate already was near the low end of its historic range, at least on the basis of current estimates, and was unlikely to decline significantly, if at all. Much would depend on consumers' outlook for employment and incomes. Growing demands should eventually be translated into faster employment gains, but at this point business firms continued to resist adding to their workforces despite increasing sales and many firms were still announcing workforce reductions. While net gains in employment, including growth associated with increases in self-employment and new business formations, were continuing, expansion in jobs and consumer incomes probably would be at a moderate pace over the year ahead. Against this background, members generally expected moderate growth in consumer spending to be maintained, but they did not see such spending as likely to give extra impetus to growth in economic activity in 1994.
