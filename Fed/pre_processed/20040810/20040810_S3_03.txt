Policymakers focused their comments about key sectors of the economy on the slowdown in consumer spending toward the end of the second quarter. Business contacts in some parts of the country suggested that, in addition to higher energy prices, unseasonable weather may have limited spending for a time. The Committee discussed a number of other factors that may have contributed to the slowdown, including a waning of the stimulus from last year's tax cuts, which had previously provided considerable impetus to spending, and the possibility that, with stock prices down, saving rates near historic lows, and the outlook more uncertain, households may have felt the need to boost saving. Although a complete accounting for the moderation in growth was not possible, the Committee agreed that a resumption of faster growth in consumer spending was very likely. Continued strength in home construction did not suggest that households were in the process of retrenching, and gains in income, low interest rates, and robust consumer confidence were seen as undergirding further gains in household spending going forward. Members noted that reports of rising motor vehicle sales in July and early August and a firming of chain store sales in recent weeks provided some limited evidence that consumption spending was picking up.
