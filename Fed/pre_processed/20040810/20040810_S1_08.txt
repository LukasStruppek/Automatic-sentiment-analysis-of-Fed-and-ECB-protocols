Business investment spending on equipment and software was solid in the second quarter, posting growth a little above the pace of the first quarter. Performance across categories, however, was uneven. Spending in the transportation equipment sector bounced back from a first-quarter decline, and outlays in the high-tech sector grew twice as fast as overall equipment and software spending in the quarter. Excluding transportation and high-tech equipment, however, gains were minimal. Real business investment in nonresidential structures turned up in the second quarter, albeit to a still-depressed level. Increased spending on office buildings, commercial structures, and various other types of buildings more than offset a sizable decline in the power generation component.
