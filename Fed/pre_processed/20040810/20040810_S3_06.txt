In their discussion of recent labor market trends, Committee members noted the slowing of job growth reported in June and July. Committee members pointed to several factors that that might have contributed to the recent weakness. Firms' focus on controlling costs and implementing further productivity improvements were doubtless continuing to play a role. Higher labor costs, particularly those related to health benefits, were also reportedly weighing on some firms' hiring decisions. However, policymakers noted that the monthly payrolls data might be providing an incomplete picture of expansion in economic activity because of near-term variation in the rate of growth of productivity. In addition, many members pointed to data from the survey of households, which showed both a rise in labor force participation and a decline in the unemployment rate in July, as well as to initial claims for unemployment compensation, which remained near recent lows. Moreover, survey data on labor market attitudes of both consumers and businesses had not signaled a significant deterioration in employment prospects. All things considered, the Committee expected the pace of employment gains to improve in coming months.
