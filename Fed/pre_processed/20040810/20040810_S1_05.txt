After rising rapidly in April and May, industrial production declined modestly in June, although manufacturing output, excluding motor vehicles and parts, increased a bit. Production of motor vehicles and parts declined noticeably, as automakers scaled back assemblies in response to elevated inventories. Output at utilities also fell in June as temperatures returned to more normal levels after an unseasonably warm May. Activity in the mining sector changed little. Overall capacity utilization was off slightly in June, but utilization on average over the quarter was above that of the first quarter. However, data on the growth in production-worker hours and other indicators of production suggested that manufacturing output bounced back in July.
