Activity in the housing market remained strong in June despite some variation across segments. Single-family housing starts fell back from very high levels in April and May. Multifamily housing starts also declined in June, though only a bit. Sales of existing homes jumped again in June to set a new record, and sales of new homes came in just below the record pace posted in May.
