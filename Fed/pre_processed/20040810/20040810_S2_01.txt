The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would continue to expand at a solid pace through 2005, supported by a relatively accommodative monetary policy over the projection period and by stimulative fiscal policy through 2004. Consumer spending was expected to strengthen in the near term, boosted by strong consumer confidence and rising disposable income, which would likely continue to be propelled by robust growth in structural productivity. Favorable financial conditions, higher profits, and the partial-expensing tax incentives over the remainder of this year were projected to lead to a near-term acceleration in business fixed investment. Subsequently, growth in capital spending was expected to moderate somewhat but still to remain on a healthy upward trajectory. Despite recent weakness in employment growth, the waning of firms' unusual caution of recent years was expected to foster a pickup in hiring over the next several quarters. Consumer price inflation was projected to remain low over the forecast period as the sharp increases in energy and import prices experienced earlier in the year partially unwound. Slack resource utilization through 2005 was also expected to help hold down inflation.
