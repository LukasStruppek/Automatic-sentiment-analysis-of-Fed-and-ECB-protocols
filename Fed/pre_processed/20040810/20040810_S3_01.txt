In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members noted that the pace of the expansion had moderated. In particular, consumer spending, which had previously provided considerable support to aggregate demand, had slowed sharply in the second quarter. At the same time, growth in payrolls had fallen back in June and July after posting significant gains in the spring. While the recent moderation in growth might portend a substantially slower expansion going forward than had previously been expected, the Committee did not see such a sizable shortfall as the most likely outcome. Activity in the housing sector remained strong, and investment outlays continued to advance at a good pace. With economic growth buoyed by accommodative monetary policy and supportive credit conditions more generally as well as by robust underlying growth in productivity, the Committee believed that conditions were in place for the pace of expansion to strengthen enough to continue to trim margins of slack in resource utilization. Indeed, the limited available evidence pointed to a rebound in household spending, especially on motor vehicles, in July and early August, and some indicators suggested continued improvement in labor market conditions. Regarding the outlook for inflation, the most recent data were seen as consistent with an assessment that a portion of the higher rates of price increases recorded earlier in the year had reflected transitory factors.
