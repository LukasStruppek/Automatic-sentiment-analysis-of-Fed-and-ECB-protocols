The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth softened somewhat in recent months. While strength in the housing market persisted and business outlays remained healthy, growth in consumer spending fell off significantly. Additionally, gains in employment, which were robust in earlier months, slowed sharply in June and July. Industrial production also decelerated modestly in June, but available indicators suggested a bounceback in July. Core consumer price inflation moderated in May and June, despite further increases in energy prices.
