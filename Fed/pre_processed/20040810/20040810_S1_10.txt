The U.S. international trade deficit declined somewhat in May after reaching a record high in April. The value of exports of goods and services climbed substantially, with exports of goods more than accounting for the entire rise, as exports of services edged down. The value of imports of goods and services also increased in the month, but by less than exports. Available data indicated that major foreign industrial economies continued to expand at a solid pace in recent months. In Japan, gains in exports and household expenditures fueled the advance in output, and surveys of business and consumer confidence were also favorable. Real GDP accelerated in the United Kingdom, and economic activity grew at a solid pace in Canada, led by a surge in investment. Indicators for the euro area suggested that activity decelerated a bit in the second quarter. Growth of real GDP in China slowed significantly in the spring.
