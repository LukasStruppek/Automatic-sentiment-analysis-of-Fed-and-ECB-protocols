The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity continued to grow at a subpar pace in recent months. Consumer spending advanced slightly in the first quarter and housing activity remained at a high level, but business investment slowed. Industrial production was sluggish, and additional slack accumulated in the labor market. Core consumer inflation had moved lower, but overall consumer prices had been pushed up recently by sharp rises in energy prices.
