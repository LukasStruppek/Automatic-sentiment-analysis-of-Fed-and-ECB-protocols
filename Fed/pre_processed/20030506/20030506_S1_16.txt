Growth in M2 slowed over March and April, but most of the deceleration appeared to be attributable to temporary tax-related flows of funds. A movement toward earlier electronic filing apparently weakened M2 in March by shifting refund distributions into February. Reduced M2 growth in April reflected, in part, slower-than-average buildups of deposits associated with final tax payments by individuals. Substantial net inflows to equity mutual funds occurred during the same period.
