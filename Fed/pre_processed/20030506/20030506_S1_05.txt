Private nonfarm payroll employment continued to fall in April. Manufacturing employment registered widespread losses, and the retail trade, transportation, and utilities industries extended their declines of prior months. The unemployment rate rose to 6 percent in April, with increases spread widely across most demographic groups. Initial claims for unemployment insurance remained at an elevated level, suggesting further labor market weakness in May.
