Real outlays on equipment and software declined in the first quarter after rising moderately over the three preceding quarters. A sharp drop in purchases of transportation equipment more than accounted for the first-quarter decline. The weakness in the transportation category reflected sluggish expenditures for aircraft, medium and heavy trucks, and light vehicles. By contrast, the high-tech category recorded strong growth owing to a surge in spending for computer and peripheral equipment and an upturn in purchases of communications equipment. Although investment fundamentals, such as corporate cash flows and reduced costs of capital, remained favorable, reports from businesses were downbeat. The extended decline in real investment spending on nonresidential structures moderated further in the first quarter, with the smallest decline since the first quarter of 2001.
