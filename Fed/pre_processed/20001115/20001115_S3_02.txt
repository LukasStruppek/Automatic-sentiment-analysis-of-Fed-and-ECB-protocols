Although the softening in aggregate demand moved in the direction of containing potential inflation pressures, the members continued to be concerned about the possibility that inflation would edge higher. Even with demand growth slower, labor markets were likely to remain unusually tight for some time, and in such circumstances labor costs could begin to rise increasingly in excess of even elevated gains in productivity. Some members also commented that energy prices might not trend lower as soon as, or to the extent, now expected by market analysts, and a few raised the prospect that the dollar might depreciate from its currently elevated level and add to potential upward pressures on domestic prices over the forecast horizon.
