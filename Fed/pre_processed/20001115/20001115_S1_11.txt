Incoming data continued to indicate that price inflation had picked up somewhat. Consumer prices, as measured by the CPI, rose considerably in September (latest data) after having edged down in August; a sizable step-up in energy prices and a noticeable increase in core inflation contributed about equally to the acceleration. Although the core measure of CPI prices accelerated noticeably in the twelve months ended in September compared with the previous twelve-month period, PCE price inflation had been about steady. By contrast, core producer prices dropped a little in October and decelerated somewhat on a year-over-year basis, though the deceleration was more than accounted for by a surge in tobacco prices during the year ended in October 1999. With regard to labor costs, the third-quarter rise in the employment cost index (ECI) for hourly compensation of private industry workers was smaller than the elevated increase of the previous quarter. However, ECI compensation advanced considerably more during the year ended in September than in the previous year, with larger increases in benefits accounting for much of the rise. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased at a slightly higher rate in both October and the twelve months ended in October.
