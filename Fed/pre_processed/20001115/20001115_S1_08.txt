Business investment in durable equipment and software decelerated sharply in the third quarter. In the high-tech area, spending on computers and related equipment as well as software recorded further robust gains. However, expenditures on communications equipment declined after a half-year of very strong increases, and outlays for other types of equipment also softened; investment in aircraft, autos, trucks, and construction and mining equipment fell, while growth of spending on agricultural and industrial equipment slowed. Despite the third-quarter weakness in expenditures, recent data on orders for nondefense capital goods suggested that spending for many types of equipment remained on an upward trend. Data on construction put in place indicated that nonresidential building activity picked up considerably in the third quarter, with the institutional, industrial, and office categories recording solid gains. Market fundamentals, including rising property values and low vacancy rates, suggested that further expansion of office building was likely. Other commercial construction, by contrast, remained weak, partly reflecting the already substantial stock of large retail stores and regional malls.
