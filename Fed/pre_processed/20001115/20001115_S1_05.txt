Industrial production edged down in October, after its growth had dropped abruptly in the third quarter to a pace well below that recorded during the first half of the year. Manufacturing output was unchanged in October; a further sharp decline in production of motor vehicles followed on the heels of a third-quarter slump, and the manufacture of other durables also fell. Expansion of output of high-tech equipment, which had been extraordinarily rapid earlier in the year, slowed somewhat in October. With production unchanged in October, the rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing fell to a level slightly below its long-term average.
