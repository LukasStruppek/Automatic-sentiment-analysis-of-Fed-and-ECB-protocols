At its meeting on October 3, 2000, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 6-1/2 percent. In taking that action, the members noted that the growth of aggregate demand had moderated appreciably, the prospects for a significant rise in inflation seemed quite limited for the near term, and previous policy tightening actions and the earlier rise in energy prices had not yet exerted their full restraining effects on demand. Nevertheless, in the context of continuing substantial pressures on labor resources and the potential effects of the previous rise in energy prices on inflation expectations, members believed it was necessary to remain on guard for signs of rising inflation over the intermediate term. As a result, they agreed that the statement accompanying the announcement of their decision should continue to indicate that the risks remained weighted mainly in the direction of rising inflation.
