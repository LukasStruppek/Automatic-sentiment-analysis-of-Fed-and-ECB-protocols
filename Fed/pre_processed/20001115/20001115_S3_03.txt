A key factor underlying the economic outlook was the emergence in recent months of less accommodative financial conditions for many businesses, including some further tightening since the meeting in early October, and decreases in the wealth of households. The slowdown in the pace of the expansion and disappointing business earnings had fostered more cautious attitudes on the part of lending institutions and investors. Anecdotal comments from around the country supported the indications from surveys of tightening terms and standards at banks for business borrowers. At the same time, spreads in securities markets had widened, most sharply on obligations of borrowers rated below investment grade, and as a result those borrowers faced higher credit costs. Lender caution and less receptive markets probably had contributed to considerable weakening recently in overall growth of credit to nonfinancial businesses. Rising interest and energy costs in conjunction with restraint on the prices of final output had depressed the earnings and stock market valuations of many firms, notably in the high-tech area, with adverse repercussions on their ability to borrow and willingness to invest and on the financial position of the households holding their equity shares.
