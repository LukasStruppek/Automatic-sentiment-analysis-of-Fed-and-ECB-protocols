Members continued to be concerned about the outlook for inflation. Measured increases in "headline" consumer prices could be explained mostly as a result of sharp advances in energy prices, which many observers expected to be reversed at some point. However, core consumer price measures also displayed a gradual uptrend, perhaps only in part as a consequence of the passthrough effects of persistently high energy prices. Measures of labor compensation appeared to be accelerating, partly as a result of sharply rising health benefit costs. To be sure, unit labor costs in the nonfinancial corporate sector had changed little over the past year, undoubtedly reflecting impressive further gains in productivity. Even so, higher interest rates and increased energy and other input costs were adding to overall production expenses. To date, competitive pressures were continuing to inhibit the ability of many firms to pass on those costs, although a significant exception was a number of successful efforts to impose energy surcharges.
