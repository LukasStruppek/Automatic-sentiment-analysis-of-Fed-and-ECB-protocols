Looking to the future, however, the members generally agreed that the risks were in the direction of a heightening in inflation pressures despite their belief that growth in overall demand now seemed to have declined to a more sustainable pace and probably would continue to expand for a time at a rate below that of the economy's output potential. The members believed that growth in labor compensation was likely to remain under upward pressure from the anticipated persistence of very tight conditions in labor markets that would enable wages to catch up to earlier gains in labor productivity. Whether offsetting increases in the growth of labor productivity would materialize was open to question, in part because productivity growth might tend to level out in the context of less ebullient expansion in business investment. Another key factor in the outlook for inflation was the course of oil and other energy prices. Thus far, increases in energy costs had been reflected only marginally in core consumer prices, and while there were widespread market expectations of declining oil prices in coming quarters, a great deal of uncertainty, including the potential for more difficulties in the Middle East, surrounded the timing and extent of such an outcome. The longer relatively high energy prices persisted, of course, the greater might be their imprint on both inflation expectations and core prices. In sum, the moderation in economic expansion, the persistence of highly competitive conditions in most domestic markets, the outlook for continued robust gains in productivity, and relatively subdued inflation expectations were favorable factors in the inflation outlook, but the members continued to view the prospects as weighted on balance in the direction of a gradual uptrend in core inflation.
