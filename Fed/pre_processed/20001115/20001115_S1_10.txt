The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed in August after having widened considerably in July; on balance, the trade deficit increased somewhat from its second-quarter level. The value of exports grew in the July-August period at about the same strong pace as that recorded for the second quarter. The value of imports also rose briskly over the two months, but at a slightly lower rate than that of the second quarter. The available information indicated that, on average, economic expansion in the foreign industrial countries slowed appreciably in the third quarter from the elevated pace during the first half of the year and that the slowdown importantly reflected little or no growth in Japan. In addition, economic activity appeared to have decelerated in many developing countries in the third quarter but remained solid in most of those nations.
