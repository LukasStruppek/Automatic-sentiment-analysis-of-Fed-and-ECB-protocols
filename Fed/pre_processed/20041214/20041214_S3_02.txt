In their discussion of important sectors of the economy, participants noted that increasing equity and home prices had boosted household net worth, leaving consumers well positioned to maintain a brisk pace of spending. Continued gains in employment were thought likely to provide additional support to spending by bolstering consumer confidence and income. Participants commented that real disposable incomes should receive a further lift from the recent drop in oil prices. Moreover, intermediate- and long-term interest rates remained low in both nominal and real terms despite the recent firming in the stance of policy, encouraging spending on consumer durables and housing.
