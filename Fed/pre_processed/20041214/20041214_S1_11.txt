Consumer prices jumped in October, as hurricane damage contributed to higher prices for food and energy. For the twelve months ending in October, consumer prices rose considerably faster than they did in the year-earlier period. Core consumer prices increased much more modestly in October than did overall consumer prices, although the twelve-month change for core prices was also somewhat higher than it was a year before. The employment cost index for private compensation advanced moderately in the year ending the third quarter, and the markup of prices over labor costs remained somewhat elevated.
