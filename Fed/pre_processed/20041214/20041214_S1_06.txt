Consumer spending appeared to be expanding at a more moderate pace in the fourth quarter, after growing at a robust rate in the third quarter. Although sales of motor vehicles declined in November, spending on other goods rose further after the large increase posted in October. Spending on services continued to register solid gains. Real disposable income, restrained by sharply higher energy prices, rose slightly. Even so, measures of consumer confidence were little changed and remained consistent with sustained increases in spending.
