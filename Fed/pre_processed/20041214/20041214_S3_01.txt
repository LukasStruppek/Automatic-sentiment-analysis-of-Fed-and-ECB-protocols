In their discussion of the economic outlook, the participants at the meeting (the members of the Board of Governors and the Reserve Bank Presidents or those acting in their place) generally regarded incoming data since the prior meeting as consistent with an expectation that the economy would continue to expand at a pace that would likely prove sufficient to reduce margins of underutilized resources further. Recent data and anecdotal information indicated that the economic expansion was firmly established and had proven quite resilient in the face of rising oil prices and the reduction in policy accommodation. Although the November employment report had been disappointing, when viewed over several months, labor market conditions were generally seen as gradually improving. That improvement was expected to persist and, along with higher wealth and relatively low interest rates, would support further gains in spending by households. Rising demand, elevated underlying productivity growth, and accommodative financial conditions should keep business spending on a strong uptrend. With some economic slack persisting and longer-term inflation expectations well-anchored, inflation was anticipated to remain subdued. A number of participants cited the recent depreciation of the dollar on foreign exchange markets, elevated energy costs, and the possibility of a slowing in underlying productivity growth as factors tending to boost the upside risks to their inflation outlook, though, on net, they saw the risks to stable underlying inflation as still balanced.
