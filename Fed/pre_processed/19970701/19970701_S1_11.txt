[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed somewhat in April from a downward-revised average rate in the first quarter. The value of exports in April rose substantially from the first-quarter level, led by increases in exports of machinery and aircraft. The value of imports also rose but by less than that of exports; imports were up in most trade categories except petroleum products. Recent information suggested that, on average, economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to grow at a moderate rate in the second quarter. Growth remained robust in Canada and the United Kingdom and was improving in Germany, France, and Italy. Economic activity appeared to have flattened temporarily in Japan following an increase in the consumption tax in April. ']
