[' Private nonfarm payroll employment rose at a reduced pace in May after having registered sizable advances over the first four months of the year. Job growth remained brisk in the services sector despite a further drop in employment at temporary help agencies that might have reflected constraints on the availability of workers for hire. Although employment in construction recovered in May from the weather-depressed level in April, the underlying growth in such jobs seemed to have slowed. Employment in manufacturing changed little over April and May after having increased moderately in the first quarter. The average workweek for production or nonsupervisory workers was unchanged in May but was slightly below the average for the first quarter. The civilian unemployment rate fell slightly further to 4.8 percent in May. ']
