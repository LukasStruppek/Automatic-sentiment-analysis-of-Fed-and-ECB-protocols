[' Price inflation remained subdued. For a third straight month, consumer prices recorded only a slight increase in May. Favorable developments in food and energy continued to hold down the overall rise and accounted for a much smaller advance in the index of prices of all consumer items over the twelve months ended in May than over the previous twelve months. The decline in core CPI inflation over the same time period was much less, though this measure of inflation also remained relatively restrained. At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy fell further in May and were little changed over the year ended that month. At earlier stages of processing, producer prices for intermediate materials other than food and energy changed little over the year ended in May, and producer prices at the crude level advanced only slightly. The tight conditions prevailing in labor markets were associated with a somewhat larger increase in average hourly earnings in the twelve months ended in May than in the year-earlier period. ']
