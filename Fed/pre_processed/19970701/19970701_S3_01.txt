[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented on the continuing exceptional performance of the economy, including widespread indications of strength in business activity and subdued inflation. Following a surge in late 1996 and earlier this year, the rate of expansion had moderated considerably in recent months, and the members generally expected economic activity to settle into a pattern of growth over the next six quarters that would approximate the economy's estimated output potential. A major factor in that outlook was their expectation of some deceleration in demands for consumer durables and business plant and equipment in light of the substantial buildup of such assets that already had taken place in recent years. However, given the underlying strength of the expansion, favorable financial conditions, and the absence of major imbalances in the economy, the risks of a different outcome were judged to be in the direction of somewhat faster growth than currently projected. The outlook for inflation was subject to particular uncertainty. Despite an economy that had been operating for a considerable period at rates of resource utilization that were very close to, and by some estimates somewhat above, sustainable levels, inflation had remained relatively low and indeed had declined on the basis of some broad measures of prices. Such an outcome was very much welcome, but the reasons for it were not completely understood and appeared to include some factors that might exert only temporary restraint on price increases. Consequently, continuing pressures on resources associated with economic growth in line with the members' current forecasts could well be reflected in rising inflation over time. "]
