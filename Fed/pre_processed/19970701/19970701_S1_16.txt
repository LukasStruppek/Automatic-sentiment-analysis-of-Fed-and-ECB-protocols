[' Expansion of M2 and M3 slowed sharply in May in association with a swing in household balances related to large tax payments; growth of M2 rebounded in June, but M3 accelerated by less. For the year through June, M2 increased at a rate near the upper bound of its range for the year. Rapid growth of M3 over the first half of the year, partly in conjunction with robust expansion of bank credit, placed growth of this aggregate somewhat above the upper bound of its range. The rate of increase in total domestic nonfinancial debt had been a little higher in recent months; for the year to date, this aggregate had grown at a rate near the middle of its range. ']
