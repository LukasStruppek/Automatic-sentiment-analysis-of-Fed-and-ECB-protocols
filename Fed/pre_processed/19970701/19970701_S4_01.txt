[" All the members favored retaining the current ranges for this year and extending them on a provisional basis to 1998. They anticipated that growth of M2 probably would continue at rates in the upper part of its current range in both years and that of M3 at rates approximating or even slightly above the upper bound of its range, given the Committee's expectations for the performance of the economy and prices. The current ranges were not expected to be guides to money growth under anticipated conditions in the period ahead, but instead could be viewed as anchors or benchmarks for money growth that would be associated with approximate price stability and sustained economic growth, assuming behavior of velocity in line with historical experience. Accordingly, a reaffirmation of those ranges would underscore the Committee's commitment to a policy of achieving price stability over time, and in the view of at least some members, higher ranges could raise questions in this regard.
