[' In their review of the outlook for economic activity in major sectors of the economy, members referred to the generally sluggish pace of retail sales in recent months. It was noted, however, that the slowdown was perhaps in part an adjustment to very strong growth of sales in previous months, and some members commented on anecdotal indications of some pickup in recent weeks. More importantly, underlying trends and fundamentals pointed to prospective growth in consumer expenditures at a pace that was likely to continue to provide key support for further moderate expansion in overall economic activity. In particular, jobs and incomes had continued to post sizable gains; further large increases in stock market prices had raised wealth-to-income ratios sharply; and consumer optimism had risen to new highs. On the other hand, the accumulation of consumer durables that had occurred over the course of the current cyclical advance was likely to exert a retarding influence on the rise in consumer spending. Other somewhat restraining factors included the prospect of some softening in housing demand and related purchases of household goods and the already heavy debt repayment burdens of many consumers. Some members also noted that a possible correction from the currently elevated levels of stock market prices could have adverse effects on consumer sentiment and purchasing power. On balance, growth in personal consumer expenditures was seen as likely to approximate the moderate rate of increase projected in overall domestic demand. ']
