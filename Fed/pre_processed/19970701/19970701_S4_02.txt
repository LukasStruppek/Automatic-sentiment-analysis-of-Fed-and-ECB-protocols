[" Over the last few years, in contrast to earlier in the 1990s, the behavior of the broad aggregates, especially that of M2, in relation to nominal GDP and short-term interest rates had displayed a pattern that was in line with historical norms prior to the 1990s. The members viewed this as an encouraging development in that it raised the possibility of giving more weight at some point to the performance of these aggregates as useful indicators in formulating monetary policy. However, the period of more predictable M2 and M3 behavior was still relatively brief and such behavior had occurred at a time of generally settled conditions in financial markets and the overall economy. The prospective performance of these aggregates in periods of rapid changes in financial and economic conditions was still an open question, and in light of the uncertainties that were involved the members concluded that it would be premature to place increased reliance on them in the conduct of policy. Accordingly, the Committee decided that despite projected growth of M2 and M3 at rates in the vicinity of the upper limits of the current ranges, prevailing uncertainties made it desirable to retain those ranges as benchmarks for the achievement of price stability rather than to establish higher ranges that seemed more likely to capture expected outcomes. In the circumstances, any tendency for growth of the monetary aggregates to move outside the Committee's ranges would not in itself call for a policy adjustment but would continue to be interpreted in the context of a broad range of business and financial developments bearing on the prospective performance of the overall economy.
