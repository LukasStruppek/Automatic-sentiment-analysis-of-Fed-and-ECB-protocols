[' In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee sets its long-run ranges for the money and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members provided individual projections of the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 1997 and 1998. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP for 1997 as a whole had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/4 percent and for 1998 were centered on a range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent. With regard to the growth of nominal GDP, most of the forecasts were in ranges of 5 to 5-1/2 percent for 1997 and 4-1/2 to 5 percent for 1998. The civilian rate of unemployment associated with these forecasts had a central tendency of 4-3/4 to 5 percent in the fourth quarters of both years. Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, pointed to a sizable moderation this year from the rate in 1996 and a partially offsetting rise in 1998, with prices of food and energy accounting for much of the swing. Specifically, the projections converged on CPI inflation rates of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent in 1997 and 2-1/2 to 3 percent in 1998. ']
