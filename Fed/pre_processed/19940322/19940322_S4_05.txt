[" In the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting adjustments to the degree of reserve pressure, a majority of the members indicated a preference for retaining a symmetric directive. While the probability of an easing action during this period was deemed to be very low, the members also did not see as very likely any firming over the intermeeting period beyond that to be implemented after today's meeting. The Committee had embarked on a course of moving away from an accommodative stance toward one that was more neutral. The timing of the actions to implement this policy was not independent of the behavior of the economy, of course, but it was not as dependent on the nuances of incoming data as policy might be at other times when the course of policy was less clear. Symmetry did not rule out an intermeeting adjustment of policy by the Chairman on behalf of the Committee, as had been done with some frequency in the past when that seemed warranted by intermeeting developments. Members who favored an asymmetric directive observed that such a directive seemed more consistent with the current thrust of monetary policy toward less accommodation and the related need to respond promptly to indications of accelerating inflation. These members indicated, however, that they could support a symmetric directive that was associated with the prospect of intermeeting consultations. "]
