[" Nonfarm payroll employment was unchanged in January but posted a February advance comparable to the sizable monthly increases recorded in the final quarter of 1993. Employment in the service industries declined slightly in January, then rebounded substantially in February. Manufacturing payrolls rose in January and February, but the number of jobs in construction declined in both months, reflecting that industry's vulnerability to weather disruptions. The civilian unemployment rate, calculated on the new basis, fell to 6.5 percent in February: however, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cautioned that a variety of technical factors might have exaggerated the decline in joblessness in early 1994.
