[" A permanent increase in the System's swap arrangement with the Bank of Mexico had been discussed at the Committee's recent meeting on March 22, and it had been contemplated at that meeting that the Committee would vote on such an increase during April in the context of the establishment of a consultative mechanism involving the finance ministries and central banks of Canada, Mexico, and the United States. However, the assassination of a major candidate for the presidency of Mexico on the evening of March 23 had prompted the closing of Mexican financial markets on March 24 and had given rise to concerns regarding possible financial market disorder in reaction to unfolding political developments when those markets reopened. Against this background, the Committee decided to join the U.S. Treasury in an action that would help confirm continued U.S. support for Mexico's economic policies at a potentially critical time for Mexican financial markets.
