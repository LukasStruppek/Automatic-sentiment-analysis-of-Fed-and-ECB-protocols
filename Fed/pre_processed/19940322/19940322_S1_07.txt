[' After a sharp rise in the fourth quarter, industrial production increased considerably further in January and February. Manufacturing output continued to rise, despite the apparent damping effect of adverse weather on a number of industries. Assemblies of motor vehicles remained quite buoyant, accounting for more than half of the increase in manufacturing production in the first two months of the year and reaching in February their highest level since the late 1970s. Production of manufactured goods other than motor vehicles also was up in the two months, but the advances were smaller than those of late 1993. Output of utilities surged in-January, reflecting the heating demand resulting from abnormally cold temperatures, but a portion of that gain was retraced in February. Total utilization of industrial capacity increased in both January and February and was at relatively elevated levels, judged by historical norms; operating rates in primary processing industries were especially high.
