[' A number of members observed that they expected consumer spending to be relatively well maintained, buttressed by considerable strength in expenditures for motor vehicles and other consumer durables. Reports on retail sales from various parts of the country tended to support such assessments, and many contacts among retailers were expressing optimism about the outlook for their sales. At the same time, some members observed that a number of factors were likely to limit the potential strength of consumer spending.

More importantly, however, consumer confidence and spending would continue to depend heavily on the outlook for further growth in employment and incomes. ']
