[' Business inventories fell slightly in January, and stocks were lean, especially at manufacturing firms. Inventories in manufacturing rose, retracing in January part of a large December decline; much of the January increase was at producers of machinery, where stocks had fallen to very low levels relative to shipments. At both the wholesale and retail levels, inventories posted sizable decreases. In the wholesale sector, the inventory-to-sales ratio edged down and had changed little since May of last year. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector was up slightly, reflecting weak sales in January. ']
