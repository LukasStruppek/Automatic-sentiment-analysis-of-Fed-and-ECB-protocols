[' The enlarged foreign exchange swap arrangement with the Bank of Mexico constituted part of a new trilateral foreign exchange swap facility established in connection with the newly formed consultative group called the North American Financial Group and comprised of the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of Canada, Mexico, and the United States.
