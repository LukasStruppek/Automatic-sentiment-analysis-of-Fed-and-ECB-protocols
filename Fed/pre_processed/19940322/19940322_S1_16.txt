[' The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies initially rose following the tightening of monetary policy on February 4. The dollar depreciated over the balance of the intermeeting period, however, despite higher U.S. interest rates and the release of data indicating generally strong U.S. economic activity. The dollar declined against both the Japanese yen and the German mark, trade frictions between the United States and Japan and disappointment over the pace of monetary easing in Germany appeared to be contributing factors in the depreciation of the dollar. Bond yields in all the major foreign industrial countries rose on average by almost as much as yields on comparable U.S. bonds. ']
