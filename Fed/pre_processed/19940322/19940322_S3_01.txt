[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to widespread indications of appreciable momentum in the economic expansion and decreasing margins of unemployed labor and other producer resources. While the members continued to anticipate a marked slowing in economic growth from the very rapid pace of the fourth quarter, some commented that despite unusually severe winter weather in large parts of the country the deceleration in the current quarter appeared to be less than they had expected. The indications of continuing strength in aggregate demand along with a still-accommodative monetary policy suggested a much reduced risk that the economic expansion would stall. Indeed, members continued to expect moderate economic growth, though perhaps for a time at a rate somewhat above the economy's potential. The amount of resources that could be mobilized readily to meet this demand was subject to substantial uncertainty, but the degree of slack in the economy clearly had diminished considerably in recent quarters to relatively low levels and likely would shrink further. The immediate outlook for inflation remained favorable: costs and prices were being contained by moderate wage increases, continuing pressures for productivity-enhancing investment, and competitive prices from abroad where slack was still quite ample; and broad measures of money and credit, though strengthening over the last half of 1993, remained moderate by historical standards. Nevertheless, looking ahead, members were concerned that, unless monetary policy were adjusted further from its still-accommodative stance, pressures on resources would intensify and inflation would pick up.
