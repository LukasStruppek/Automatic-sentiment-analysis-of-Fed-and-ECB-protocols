[' As had been the case at the February meeting, views differed on how much further current monetary policy should be adjusted at this meeting. Many members noted that money market interest rates would have to rise by a relatively sizable amount from current levels, given underlying economic conditions, but a majority indicated a preference for another small move at this time. Many were concerned about a possible overreaction in financial markets that had become quite sensitive and volatile since early February. A few also placed some emphasis on their expectations of a considerable slowdown in the rate of economic growth and the possibility that the moderation of the expansion might prove to be somewhat more pronounced than was currently projected. In this view, a degree of caution was advisable to permit an assessment of ongoing developments. ']
