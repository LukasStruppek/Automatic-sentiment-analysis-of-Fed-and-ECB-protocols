In preparation for the Federal Reserveâ€™s semiannual report to the Congress on the economy and monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of nominal and real GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for the years 2007 and 2008, conditioned on their views of the appropriate path for monetary policy. The projections for the growth of nominal GDP were in the range of 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, with a central tendency of 4-1/2 to 5 percent for 2007; for 2008, the projections for nominal GDP growth ranged between 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 with a central tendency of 4-3/4 to 5 percent. Projections for the rate of expansion in real GDP in 2007 were in a range from 2 to 2-3/4 percent in 2007, with a central tendency of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent; for 2008, the projections ranged between 2-1/2 to 3 percent, with a central tendency of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent. These rates of growth were associated with civilian unemployment rates in the range of 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 and 4-1/2 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008; the central tendency of these projections was 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent in 2007 and about 4-3/4 percent in 2008. Projections for the rate of inflation, as measured by the core PCE price index, in 2007 were in a range of 2 to 2-1/4 percent in 2007 and 1-3/4 to 2 percent in 2008. The central tendencies of these projections in 2007 and 2008 were identical to the ranges for those years. Participants generally agreed that the housing sector was likely to remain a drag on growth for some time yet and represented the most significant downside risk to the economic outlook. Although starts of single-family homes had moved up, on balance, over recent months, permits for new construction continued to decline. A number of participants noted that inventories of new homes for sale remained quite elevated. Housing activity was seen as likely to continue to contract for several more quarters. Participants also identified a number of downside risks associated with their outlook for residential construction. The recent increase in interest rates for prime mortgages could further dampen the demand for housing. Moreover, a number of participants pointed to rising mortgage delinquency rates and related difficulties in the subprime mortgage market as factors that could crimp the availability of mortgage credit and the demand for housing.
