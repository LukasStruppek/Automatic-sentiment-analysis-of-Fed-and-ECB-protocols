Securities lending of APP holdings had been gradually increasing, especially as regards government bonds held under the public sector purchase programme. Moreover, September had brought an increase in the issuance of private sector securities, which had had a positive impact on the implementation of both the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) and the asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP). Since the announcement of the programme in March 2016, monthly issuance in the CSPP universe had exceeded that seen in the same months of the previous year, and the weighted average maturity of the corporate bonds issued had been around 1.5 years longer. Specifically, more than €20 billion of euro-denominated investment grade non-financial corporate bonds had come to the market in September, and the relatively strong issuance had continued in October. Despite the strong primary market activity, the yield spreads of euro-denominated investment grade non-financial corporate bonds had remained broadly stable. Primary issuance in the asset-backed securities (ABS) market had also picked up, although not on the same scale as the CSPP market. ABS issuance had also been broad-based in terms of both jurisdictions and types of ABS.
