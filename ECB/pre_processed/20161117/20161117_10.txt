Turning to euro area activity, in the second quarter real GDP had increased by 0.3% quarter on quarter. At the same time, consumption had continued to grow on the back of stronger than expected employment growth in the second quarter, at a rate of 0.4% quarter on quarter, while wage growth remained moderate, reflecting temporary factors such as pent-up wage restraint and continued slack in the economy in a low-inflation environment. The unemployment rate declined to 10.1% in the second quarter, remaining at that level in July and August.
