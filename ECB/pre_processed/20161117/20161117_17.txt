Turning to money and credit, the annual growth rate of M3 had stood at 5.1% in August, after 4.9% in July, hence remaining at a level of around 5% since April 2015. The growth in M3 had mainly been driven by its most liquid components, with annual M1 growth edging up to 8.9%, from 8.4% in July. As regards loan dynamics, both the annual growth rate of loans from monetary financial institutions (MFIs) to NFCs and that of MFI loans to households had remained unchanged, at 1.9% and 1.8% respectively, in August. According to the October 2016 bank lending survey for the euro area, credit standards for loans to enterprises had remained unchanged in the third quarter of 2016 after nine consecutive quarters of easing, while those for loans to households had eased further. Competitive pressures continued to exert an easing impact on credit standards.
