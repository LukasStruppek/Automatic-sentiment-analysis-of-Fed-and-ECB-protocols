With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction. Broad money (M3) had continued to increase at a robust pace in August 2016, mainly supported, as in previous months, by its most liquid components. Loan dynamics had continued on the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014, with the growth of loans to NFCs and households in August progressing at levels unchanged from July.
