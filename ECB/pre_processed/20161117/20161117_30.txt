Members also recalled that the outlook for a continued cyclical recovery was based on exceptionally supportive financing conditions, which benefited to a large extent from the ECBâ€™s monetary policy measures. They also re-emphasised that the accommodative monetary policy was, in itself, not sufficient for a self-sustained recovery and that other policy areas had to make more decisive contributions. Structural reforms were seen as essential to enhance competition, lay the foundations for sustainable growth and provide a more favourable investment climate by improving the medium to long-term return on capital. The point was also made that further progress was required in the necessary intra-euro area rebalancing across countries.
