As regards communication, members broadly agreed with the proposals put forward by Mr Praet in his introduction. A balanced communication was warranted which would provide reassurance about the Governing Council’s commitment to preserve the very substantial amount of monetary support that was necessary to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% without undue delay, while at the same time being mindful not to trigger undue expectations in financial markets about future monetary policy action. Accordingly, the Governing Council should, fully in line with its previous communication, reiterate its forward guidance on asset purchases and policy rates, whereby the monthly asset purchases of €80 billion were intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. Moreover, policy rates continued to be expected to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. To this end, it was important to underline the Governing Council’s ability and readiness to act, if warranted, to achieve its objective by using all the instruments available within its mandate.
