The September 2016 ECB staff projections for inflation remained broadly in line with the latest forecasts from the private sector and other international organisations for 2016 and 2017. The SPF for the fourth quarter of 2016 showed average inflation expectations of 0.2%, 1.2% and 1.4% for 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively, i.e. marginally lower than in the survey for the third quarter, while expectations five years ahead remained unchanged at 1.8%. At the same time, inflation-linked swap rates had recovered somewhat following the decline that had taken place around the time of the UK referendum, with the five-year forward rate five years ahead standing at 1.42% on 18 October.
