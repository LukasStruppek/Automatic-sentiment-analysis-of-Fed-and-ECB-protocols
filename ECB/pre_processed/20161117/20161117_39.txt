Members stressed that the transmission of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continued to be effective in ensuring very favourable borrowing conditions for firms and households. In this context, the TLTROs were mentioned, which had led to substantial funding cost relief that banks were able to pass on to their customers, despite a diverse take-up across euro area countries. Bank lending rates had continued their broad-based decline to new historic lows, supporting the recovery of lending to the private sector. This was also confirmed by the results from the recent bank lending survey for the third quarter, with banks reporting further improvements in both supply and demand conditions for loans to the non-financial private sector overall and, in particular, net loan demand increasing across all loan categories. Credit conditions had also remained very favourable, mainly on the back of increasing competitive pressures in the banking sector. Credit standards had eased further for loans to households and, after nine months of continued easing, had been unchanged for NFCs, although they were expected to tighten somewhat in the next quarter. Furthermore, banks continued to report that the ECBâ€™s APP and the negative deposit facility rate had contributed to more favourable terms and conditions on new loans, which overall saw a further net easing.
