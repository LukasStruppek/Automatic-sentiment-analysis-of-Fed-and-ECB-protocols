With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment, presented by Mr Praet in his introduction, of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area. Recent data and survey results confirmed a continued moderate but steady recovery of the euro area economy, which had so far shown some resilience to adverse external shocks and a range of uncertainties. Looking ahead, domestic demand growth was seen to continue along the previously expected path, supported by growth in private consumption and improvements in investment. Short and medium-term growth prospects were seen to be dampened by uncertainty pertaining to political and economic developments, both globally and in the euro area, which could weigh, in particular, on the outlook for private investment. The balance of risks to the euro area outlook was considered to remain tilted to the downside.
