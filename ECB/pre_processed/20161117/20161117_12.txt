Real growth in total housing investment had been 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter, down from 0.5% in the first quarter, confirming overall the ongoing recovery in the housing market in the first six months of the year. At the same time, real non-construction investment had recovered to its pre-crisis peak, while investment in machinery and equipment remained below pre-crisis levels. The net operating surplus of euro area non-financial corporations (NFCs) had rebounded in year-on-year terms in the second quarter. However, recent increases in profitability had only partially translated into higher investment, resulting in a further increase in retained earnings and the net lending position of NFCs.
