Assessing the policy options, Mr Praet deemed that the information that had become available since the previous monetary policy meeting on 4-5 March did not give grounds to reconsider the monetary policy stance or any of the APP parameters. Accordingly, the focus should continue to be on the firm implementation of the announced measures. To this end, the Governing Council needed to reconfirm that the APP purchases were intended to be carried out until the end of September 2016 – and in any case until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that was consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The Governing Council should also stress that the implementation of asset purchases was proceeding smoothly, with volumes in line with the announced figure of €60 billion of securities per month, as had been presented by Mr Cœuré.
