Daily purchases of securities under the PSPP had been around €3.2 billion on average. For the APP overall, the announced volume of €60 billion per month had been achieved in the first month of the programme’s implementation. The concerns of some market participants that the ECB would have difficulty meeting purchase targets had thus far not materialised. Such concerns were based on the presumption that the ECB would at some stage exhaust the supply from price-elastic sellers and on the expectation that the yield on an increasing number of bonds would fall below the ECB’s deposit facility rate. However, these issues did not seem to be pressing at this stage.
