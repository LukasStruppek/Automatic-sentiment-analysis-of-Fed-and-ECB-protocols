With regard to the monetary policy stance, members generally shared the assessment that a significant number of positive effects were visible from the expanded APP, in conjunction with the package of measures decided in June-September 2014 â€“ namely an easing in financial market conditions and in the cost of external finance for the private sectors. Moreover, most recent data and survey evidence suggested that the euro area economy had gained further momentum since the end of 2014, that there were signs of an improvement in inflation dynamics and that money and credit were firming. This provided support for a scenario of a gradual broadening and deepening of the recovery and a return of inflation rates towards 2%. It was recalled, however, that such a scenario was predicated on the full implementation of all monetary policy measures taken by the Governing Council since mid-2014.
