Intraday volatility in the foreign exchange market had been exceptionally high on 18 March 2015. The euro’s exchange rate against the US dollar climbed from USD 1.06 to USD 1.10 within a few hours, resulting in an overall intraday move of around 4.4%, the second largest intraday move since the creation of the euro. The only bigger move in the USD/EUR exchange rate had taken place on 22 September 2000, when the ECB intervened in the foreign exchange market. According to some analysts, the March move had been amplified by thin liquidity – as it occurred just after the close of the New York session, when the market volume is usually at its lowest over the daily cycle – and by the unwinding of very large non-commercial short euro positions.
