Structural reforms were needed to boost euro area potential output, which monetary policy by itself could not achieve. It was therefore essential that the current accommodative monetary policy stance found its natural complement in the right set of structural reform policies in order to support the cyclical recovery and ensure that it also translated into higher potential output growth and lower structural unemployment. The focus would need to be placed on structural reform measures which would not only help to lift medium to longer-term growth potential, but could already, in the short term, raise expectations of permanently higher incomes and thereby encourage both households to expand consumption and firms to increase investment.
