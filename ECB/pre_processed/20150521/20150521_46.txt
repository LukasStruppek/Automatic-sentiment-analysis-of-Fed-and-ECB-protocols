With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction that money and loan dynamics had strengthened further. Growth in broad money continued to be supported by its most liquid components. Loan dynamics had gradually improved further, confirming the turnaround in loan dynamics that had been under way since the first half of 2014. This appeared to be due to improvements in both credit demand and supply, reflecting, in particular, banksâ€™ improved capital positions and the monetary policy measures in place. Despite these improvements, the dynamics of loans to non-financial corporations had remained subdued and uneven across euro area countries. This reflected the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets, which was as yet incomplete.
