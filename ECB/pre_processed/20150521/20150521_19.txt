The euro area economy had gained further momentum at the beginning of 2015. More specifically, both the composite output PMI and the European Commissionâ€™s economic sentiment indicator had improved between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015. Both indicators had stood, in the first quarter of 2015, above their respective long-term averages. In February 2015, industrial production (excluding construction) had increased by 1.1%, month on month, and, on average, in January and February the index had stood 0.7% above its average level in the fourth quarter of 2014. Private consumption dynamics appeared to have held up. The combined indicator of retail sales and new passenger car registrations for January and February stood, on average, almost 2% above its average level for the last quarter of 2014. Moreover, consumer confidence had risen further in March to levels not seen since the summer of 2007.
