With regard to price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the outlook presented by Mr Praet in his introduction. Headline HICP inflation appeared to have bottomed out, as the annual rate of change had been -0.1% in March 2015, up from -0.3% in February and -0.6% in January. Reference was also made to the latest evidence on the recovery of survey and market-based inflation expectations. Overall, it was noted that the Governing Council’s monetary policy measures had contributed to the improved outlook for inflation. While the immediate impact of the measures appeared to be less strong on the nominal side than on the real side, confidence was expressed that the full implementation of the monetary policy measures would help bring price developments further back into line with the Governing Council’s aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term and would dispel concerns about downside risks to price stability. It was also noted that, in any event, there appeared to be no signs of deflationary behaviour among consumers, as consumption of durable goods, which typically would be deferred in a deflationary environment, had been growing strongly over recent quarters.
