The performance of equity markets had been exceptionally strong. Since the monetary policy meeting of 4-5 March, total returns on the Euro Stoxx 50 and the Euro Stoxx Banks equity indices had been 7.5% and 10% respectively, which was much higher than the total returns on the sovereign bond markets. This strong reaction by the equity markets had, in the view of market participants, been driven by the decreasing returns on bond investments, and investors had clearly shifted from bonds to equities. The strength of the performance of bank stocks had been attributed by some market analysts to an increase in the valuation of the banks’ sovereign bond holdings.
