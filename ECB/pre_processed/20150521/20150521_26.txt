Turning to monetary and financial conditions, nominal yields had declined further to historically low levels. ThisÂ had also been the case for corporate bond spreads over the past few months in the majority of euro area countries and for the overall nominal cost of external financing for euro area non-financial corporations (NFCs). Bank lending rates remained on a declining trend amid monthly volatility. The composite bank lending rates for euro area NFCs had declined to 2.3% in February, after 2.8% in June 2014. Bank lending rates on loans to households for house purchase stood at just under 2.4%, down from 2.9% in June 2014.
