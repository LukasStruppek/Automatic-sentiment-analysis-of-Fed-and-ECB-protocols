In the foreign exchange market, the euro had reached a low of USD 1.05 per euro after the start of the APP, thus depreciating by 25% since May 2014. According to some market participants, this move had been underpinned by continued net outflows from euro area government bond markets, which had accelerated with the decline in sovereign bond yields. The effect of these outflows on the euroâ€™s exchange rate had been somewhat mitigated by equity inflows from non-euro area investors. In January 2015, the net combined bond and equity flows to and from the euro area as reported in the balance of payments had been positive for the first time since June 2014, since equity inflows to the euro area had exceeded bond outflows. Anecdotal evidence suggested that equity inflows had gathered momentum in February and March, which was consistent with the rise in euro area equity issuance observed in the first quarter.
