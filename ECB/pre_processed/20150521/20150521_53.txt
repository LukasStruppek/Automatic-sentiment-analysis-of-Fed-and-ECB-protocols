There was wide agreement that the expanded APP had been progressing smoothly since the start of the public sector securities purchases on 9 March 2015, with purchase volumes in line with the announced monthly figure of €60 billion. Liquidity was generally ample across markets and jurisdictions, while market concerns about scarcity in some market segments appeared to be overstated. It was underlined that the design of the programme provided sufficient flexibility for it to be adapted if circumstances were to change and should the need arise. In any case, the implementation aspects of the programme and its various parts would be closely monitored, ensuring the APP’s continued smooth functioning and a consistent implementation across the Eurosystem.
