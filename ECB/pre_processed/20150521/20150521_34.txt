In evaluating whether such a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation was materialising, the Governing Council would follow its monetary policy strategy and concentrate on trends in inflation, looking through unexpected outcomes in measured inflation in either direction if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability. Accordingly, it would continue to assess the outlook on the basis of various tools and indicators of realised and expected inflation, and not mechanically adjust its stance in response to any isolated macroeconomic indicator.
