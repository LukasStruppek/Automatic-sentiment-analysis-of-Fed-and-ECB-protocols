In the corporate bond market, price gains had been significantly lower than those of sovereign bonds when comparing the respective Markit iBoxx indices, with the sovereign index up by 1.6% and the non-financial corporate index up by 0.3%. Euro-denominated issuance outside the euro area by non-resident firms had increased. Foreign companies had benefited from a substantial funding advantage when issuing in euro and swapping back into US dollars, instead of issuing directly in US dollars, thus expanding the role of the euro as a funding currency. Issuance had been concentrated on longer-term maturities, which was consistent with the flattening of the yield curve for corporate bonds.
