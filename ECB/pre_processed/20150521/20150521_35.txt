With regard to the economic analysis, the members of the Governing Council concurred with the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction. The latest data and survey evidence confirmed that economic growth had gained further momentum. Looking ahead, improved financial conditions, the lower price of oil and the depreciation of the euro were seen to be supportive of a gradual broadening and strengthening of the recovery, while further balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of structural reforms were expected to dampen its pace. Several comments were made on the relationship between the non-standard monetary policy measures adopted by the Governing Council and the outlook for economic activity, with broad agreement prevailing that these measures played an important role in supporting economic growth by lowering borrowing costs, by working through confidence and financial channels and via the impact on exchange rates.
