With regard to international developments, the release of the Federal Open Market Committeeâ€™s statement on 18 March had had a strong impact on global financial markets. The Committee had lowered its projections for GDP growth and core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation, as well as its expectations for the appropriate pace and magnitude of monetary policy tightening, as reflected by the midpoints of target ranges or the target level for the federal funds rate. The release of unexpectedly weak non-farm payroll data on 3 April 2015 had further increased the expectation that a rate hike would come later in 2015, even though a hike in June was still not completely ruled out by market participants.
