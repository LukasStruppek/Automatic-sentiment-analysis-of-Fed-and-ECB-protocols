The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had increased further in March, pointing to sustained real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2015. However, the global recovery was expected to remain gradual and uneven across regions, with survey indicators of output standing above long-term averages in advanced economies and well below in a number of emerging market economies. Global trade had recently also shown signs of softening. World merchandise trade had plunged in January, driven mainly by declining import volumes in emerging market economies. Meanwhile, the pace of growth in imports had improved among advanced economies. The global PMI for new export orders had declined slightly in March 2015, indicating stable momentum in global trade. Annual OECD CPI inflation had remained subdued and had stood at 0.6% in February. Excluding food and energy, it was 1.7%. Since the Governing Council’s March monetary policy meeting, the price of Brent crude oil had decreased by about 7% to stand at around USD 57 per barrel on 13 April, although it remained more than 20% above its mid-January lows. Non-energy commodity prices had declined slightly by 3.5%, mainly on account of lower food prices. The euro had depreciated by 5.7% against the US dollar and by 4.3% in nominal effective terms.
