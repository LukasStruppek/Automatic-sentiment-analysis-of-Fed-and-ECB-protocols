In greater detail, encouraging evidence was seen with regard to the effectiveness of the monetary policy measures in place. In particular, their impact on financial markets was clearly visible, as highlighted by Mr Cœuré in his introduction. Financial market conditions and the cost of external finance for the private sector had eased considerably over the past few months, reflecting the transmission of the monetary policy measures through the financial intermediation chain, particularly to borrowing costs for households and firms. At the same time, it was remarked that the impact on the real economy and inflation required more time to unfold and that the PSPP had been running for just over one month. The broad-based improvement in financial conditions for the time being confirmed that the monetary policy measures were working in the intended direction, lending support for the economic recovery to proceed in line with the outlook contained in the March ECB staff projections. It was also noted that market-based measures of inflation expectations had recovered from the low levels observed in mid-January 2015, even though further improvements should materialise. Moreover, it appeared that the decisive policy action by the ECB had dispelled market fears of deflation, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the price of deflation protection.
