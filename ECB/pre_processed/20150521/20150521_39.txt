Overall, members considered that the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area, while remaining on the downside, had become more balanced as a result of the recent monetary policy decisions, the past decline in oil prices and the depreciation of the euro. Downside risks to growth were seen to stem from the external environment, as geopolitical risks remained high in several neighbouring regions of the EU. Furthermore, financial turbulence emanating from political developments and stalling programme negotiations in Greece was considered to be a source of downside risks. An additional downside risk related to potential further deleveraging in a number of sectors of the economy, including the banking sector and non-financial private sectors in some parts of the euro area.
