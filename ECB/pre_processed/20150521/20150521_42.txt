Structural reforms were seen as essential to complement the monetary policy actions of the ECB. It was therefore important to stress that monetary policy could not replace structural reforms. In addition, there was some risk that the lower bound to monetary policy rates could be invoked as an excuse to delay structural reforms in an environment of low inflation. Some recent academic literature suggested that structural reforms could be contractionary when interest rates were at the zero lower bound, as they could reduce inflation, raise real interest rates and thus depress domestic demand. However, these research findings were explicitly predicated on the absence of an appropriate monetary stimulus and were hence not currently applicable to the euro area, following the non-standard monetary policy measures put in place by the Governing Council, which provided additional monetary accommodation supporting inflation expectations and low real interest rates.
