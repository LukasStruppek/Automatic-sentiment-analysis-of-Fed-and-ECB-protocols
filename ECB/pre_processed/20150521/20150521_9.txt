Regarding the other constituent programmes of the APP, settled ABS purchases had reached €1.2 billion for March and cumulative purchases stood at €4.6 billion under the ABSPP at the end of March. The Eurosystem had participated in four primary market issuances and also in some retained deals. ABS issuance had been picking up, in line with its usual seasonal pattern and, based on this pattern, an increase in ABS issuance was expected in the second quarter of the year. Covered bond purchases had been €12.4 billion in March, also supported by participation in a number of primary issuances. Cumulative purchases under the programme amounted to €63.6 billion at the end of March, with primary market issuance accounting for 18.9%. Given the traditionally slow second quarter in primary market issuance in the covered bond market, such strong issuance and purchases might not be observed in subsequent weeks.
