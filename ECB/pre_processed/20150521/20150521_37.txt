A number of considerations were put forward on the outlook for individual demand components. Consumption was expected to be the main driver of domestic demand, reflecting positive developments in real disposable income. At the same time, some caution was expressed that consumption growth could lose momentum, also in view of the continued need for balance sheet repair by households and banks in some parts of the euro area. A recovery in investment was seen as crucial for ensuring a sustained improvement in overall economic growth. While a number of conditions appeared to be in place for a pick-up in private investment, most notably favourable financing conditions for debt and equity, other indicators such as profit developments and the business climate were still mixed and did not, for the time being, provide support for a substantial acceleration in investment growth. Finally, it was noted that net exports had provided considerable support to growth, but it remained to be seen whether this would continue in the future, given the generally weak outlook for global trade and the prevailing geopolitical uncertainties.
