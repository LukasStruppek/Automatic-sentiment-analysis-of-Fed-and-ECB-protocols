Summing up, Mr Praet noted that the euro area economy had gained further momentum since the end of 2014, with increasing signs that the economic recovery would broaden and strengthen gradually â€“ consistent with what had been expected in the March 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. Moreover, risks surrounding the economic outlook, while remaining on the downside, had become more balanced. The downward trend in headline inflation also appeared to have come to a halt and most measures of inflation expectations had recovered from their troughs in mid-January. The monetary policy decisions taken by the Governing Council in January had made a strong contribution in confronting the risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation. Cross-checking the results of the economic analysis with the evidence from the monetary analysis, money and credit dynamics had strengthened further in a context of improving financial conditions and were also consistent with the outlook of a gradual recovery in euro area growth and inflation.
