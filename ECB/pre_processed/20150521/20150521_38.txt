With respect to the analysis of the economic outlook, it was seen as useful to disentangle developments in actual and potential output growth in order to clarify the respective roles of demand-side and supply-side policies. The cyclical nature of the projected recovery was emphasised, with potential growth remaining low, curtailing the scope for a sustained recovery. In particular, the key role of investment in supporting demand and enhancing productive capacity was recalled. Some interrelationship was highlighted between investment and potential growth, as current investment choices largely depended on potential growth prospects, while the potential growth profile was in turn shaped by current investment demand. In this context, it was also underlined that estimates of potential growth and the output gap were surrounded by substantial measurement uncertainties.
