Regarding inflation expectations, the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the second quarter of 2015 indicated that the expected five-year-ahead inflation rate stood at 1.84%, after 1.77% in the previous survey. AtÂ the same time, longer-term market-based inflation expectations in the euro area had recovered from their low mid-January levels. For instance, on 13 April the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead stood at 1.7%, after a trough of around 1.5% in mid-January. Shorter-term market-based measures had also increased since mid-January, more markedly so in the weeks leading up to the present meeting.
