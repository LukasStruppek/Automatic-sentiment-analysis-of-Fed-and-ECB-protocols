Members emphasised that the risk of insufficient reform progress was particularly pronounced with regard to structural policies, which were hampered by resistance to change. In the absence of structural reforms, there were serious risks that potential output growth would remain low and investment demand would not pick up as strongly as expected. Measures to enhance potential output growth were considered essential, not least in view of the declining working-age population in the euro area and the ensuing funding difficulties for pension systems, which could only be addressed through determined measures to lift total factor productivity. Furthermore, a lack of structural reforms could dampen not only potential growth but also actual economic growth in the euro area. In that context, it was recalled that, while the long-term demand effects of structural reforms were undisputedly positive and should be seen as the main motivation for such reforms, the short-term effects were less clear and largely depended on the nature of the policy measures taken. For instance, while reforms of judicial systems would most likely yield immediate benefits, this was less obvious in the case of labour market reforms, as increased flexibility in labour markets could initially depress demand, a point that had been underlined in work undertaken by the OECD. At the same time, it was argued that labour and product market reforms could have a positive short-run effect on demand, as expectations of rising permanent income could help bring forward both investment and consumption demand and higher potential output could reduce concerns about debt sustainability, thereby generating fiscal space and mitigating the incentive for consumers to save in anticipation of future tax liabilities. Overall, it was seen as important to prioritise those structural reforms with a frontloaded positive impact on growth.
