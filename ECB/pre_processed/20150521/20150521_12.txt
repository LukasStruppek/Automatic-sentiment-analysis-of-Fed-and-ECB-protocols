The EONIA was experiencing some downward rigidity, with the average standing at -5.6 basis points in the second reserve maintenance period, which was lower than at the end of 2014 but still significantly above the deposit facility rate. The EONIA forward rate for the end of 2015 was set at -15 basis points. It was possible that a deposit rate cut – albeit minor – was still priced in, as suggested by the negative tail of option-implied densities.
