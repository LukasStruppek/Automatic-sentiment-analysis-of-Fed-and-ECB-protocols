It was highlighted that borrowing conditions for firms and households had improved further since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, which was seen as a sign of receding impairments in the credit channel of monetary policy, permitting the effective transmission of the policy measures taken by the Governing Council. Bank lending rates for non-financial corporations and households had continued their declining trend, despite some monthly volatility, thereby supporting credit demand. This was consistent with the evidence from the April 2015 bank lending survey, which showed a further net easing in credit standards and credit terms and conditions. Nonetheless, it was cautioned that lending rates had not fallen as much as might have been expected given the current level of policy rates, which was possibly related to the continued need for adjustments in banks’ balance sheets in some parts of the euro area.
