With regard to the economic analysis, members generally shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction. Real GDP growth had moderated in the first quarter of 2018, following very high levels of growth in 2017. The latest indicators and survey results were also weaker, but remained consistent with ongoing solid and broad-based economic growth over the next few quarters. Looking further ahead, fundamentals remained in place for a continued expansion over the medium term. This outlook was broadly reflected in the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, which entailed a downward revision for real GDP growth in 2018 compared with the March 2018 ECB staff projections, while the outlook for 2019 and 2020 was broadly unchanged, entailing a gradual slowing of growth. The risks surrounding the outlook for activity were overall assessed to have remained broadly balanced, notwithstanding greater uncertainty related to global factors and risks of heightened financial market volatility.
