As regards the convergence criterion, the staff projections indicated that headline inflation and inflation excluding energy and food would reach 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively, in 2020, a trajectory that had become increasingly entrenched over a number of projection exercises. This was seen to confirm that inflation was well on course to converge to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Confidence in the expected inflation path was bolstered by diminishing uncertainty around the inflation outlook, as reflected in the narrowing dispersion of distributions around inflation forecasts, surveys and market expectations, in an environment in which deflation risks had essentially disappeared. Moreover, while measures of underlying inflation remained muted overall, continued economic growth above potential – with high levels of capacity utilisation and a progressive tightening in labour markets indicating supply constraints might increasingly come into play – increased confidence that price and wage pressures would strengthen further over time, lending support to continued inflation convergence.
