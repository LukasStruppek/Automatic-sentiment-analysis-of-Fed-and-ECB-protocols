Overall, the proposed formulation, indicating the Governing Council’s expectation that policy rates would be kept at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remained aligned with a sustained adjustment path, was seen to strike a good balance between providing sufficiently precise guidance and maintaining adequate flexibility. The proposed state-contingent component of the forward guidance on policy rates was widely seen as underlining the gradual and data-dependent approach to policy normalisation. In this regard, explicitly linking a first policy rate rise to inflation evolving along a sustained adjustment path was seen as consistent with the ECB’s forward-looking and medium-term-oriented monetary policy strategy and would underscore the credibility of the Governing Council’s commitment to its price stability objective.
