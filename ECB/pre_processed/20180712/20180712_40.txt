As regards developments in inflation expectations, members noted that both market-based measures and survey-based measures had, progressively, been moving in a favourable direction. Longer-term inflation expectations seemed on the whole to be anchored. Reference was made to the aggregate probability distribution of two-years ahead expectations derived from the SPF, which had clearly moved in the desired direction. The mode of the distribution had shifted to the right and at present appeared broadly aligned with the Governing Councilâ€™s inflation aim. At the same time, the narrower dispersion of the distribution around its modal value signalled that SPF respondents had on balance become more certain that inflation would indeed be close to these higher levels. The shift in the distribution also provided further confirmation that deflation scenarios had been practically priced out. The five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had edged up since the April monetary policy meeting and had been relatively stable at around 1.7% for some time, showing little volatility.
