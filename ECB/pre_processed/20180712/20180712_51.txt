On this basis, members unanimously agreed with the proposal made by Mr Praet in his introduction to reconfirm the forward guidance on the Governing Councilâ€™s reinvestment policy, while enhancing the forward guidance on policy interest rates. On reinvestment, the Governing Council reiterated its intention to maintain its policy of reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary. It was highlighted that the future reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities would imply a continued sizable presence of the Eurosystem in euro area securities markets, thereby contributing significantly to favourable liquidity conditions and the overall accommodative monetary policy stance.
