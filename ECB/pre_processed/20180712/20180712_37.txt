With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by MrÂ Praet in his introduction. Annual euro area HICP inflation had increased to 1.9% in May 2018, after 1.2% in April. This reflected higher contributions from energy, food and services price inflation. Looking ahead, on the basis of current oil futures prices, annual rates of headline inflation were likely to hover around the current level for the remainder of the year. While measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, they had been increasing from earlier lows, and domestic cost pressures and wages were strengthening. Underlying inflation was therefore expected to pick up towards the end of the year and to increase gradually thereafter.
