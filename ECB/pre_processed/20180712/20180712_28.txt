In addition, the Governing Council’s communication should provide more guidance on the likely evolution of monetary policy over time, as follows. First, the Eurosystem would continue to make net asset purchases under the APP at the current monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of September 2018. Second, the Governing Council would express its anticipation that, after September, subject to incoming data continuing to provide confirmation of the baseline medium-term inflation outlook, it would reduce the monthly pace of the net asset purchases to €15 billion until the end of December 2018 and then end net purchases. Third, it intended to maintain its policy of reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after ending net purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Fourth, the Governing Council expected to keep the key ECB interest rates at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remained broadly aligned with its current expectations of a sustained adjustment path. Fifth, the Governing Council should reiterate that significant monetary policy stimulus was still needed for a continued sustained convergence of inflation towards its aim and that this support would continue to be provided by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by the enhanced forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates. Sixth, the Governing Council should emphasise that it stood ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continued to move towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term in a sustained manner.
