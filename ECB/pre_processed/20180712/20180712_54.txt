Against this background, members agreed with the communication proposals made by MrÂ Praet in his introduction. It needed to be emphasised that, while the incoming data had been somewhat weaker than previously expected, the fundamentals remained in place for the medium-term growth outlook to remain solid and broad-based, as also embodied in the June 2018 Eurosystem staff projections. Accordingly, it needed to be highlighted that the underlying strength of the euro area expansion, together with rising price pressures, well-anchored inflation expectations and the continuing ample degree of monetary accommodation, provided grounds for confidence in the sustained convergence of inflation. At the same time, it had to be acknowledged that, although the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook had remained broadly balanced overall, the incoming information suggested some downside risks to the short-term growth outlook, while risks related to global factors, including the threat of increased protectionism, had become more prominent.
