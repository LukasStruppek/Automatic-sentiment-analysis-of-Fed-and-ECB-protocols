With regard to price developments, according to Eurostatâ€™s flash estimate annual HICP inflation had stood at 1.9% in May, up from 1.2% in April. HICP inflation excluding energy and food had been 1.1% in May, up from 0.7% in April. Measures of underlying inflation had remained generally muted but were on a path of gradual improvement. Recent declines in non-energy industrial goods price inflation were largely due to the volatile clothing and footwear component and did not provide clear signs of downward pressure from the exchange rate pass-through. The observed upward trend in wage growth reflected improved labour market conditions, while other factors that weighed on wage growth, including past low inflation, were beginning to fade.
