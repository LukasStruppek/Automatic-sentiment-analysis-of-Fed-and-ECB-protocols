This assessment was also broadly reflected in the June 2018 Eurosystem staff projections, which projected annual HICP inflation at 1.7% in each year of the 2018-20 projection horizon. Compared with the March 2018 ECB staff projections, this entailed an upward revision for 2018 and 2019, which mainly reflected higher oil prices. It was highlighted that the sequence of recent projections had either confirmed the outlook for medium-term inflation or shown an improvement, providing grounds for increased confidence that inflation would converge to the ECB’s medium-term aim of inflation below, but close to, 2%. It was, however, also underlined that the recent increase in headline inflation was mainly driven by energy prices and that further convergence towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim relied on an expected pick-up in underlying inflation.
