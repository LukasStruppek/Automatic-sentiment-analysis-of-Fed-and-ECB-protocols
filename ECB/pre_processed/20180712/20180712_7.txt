Turning to the euro area economy, following robust growth rates of 0.7% quarter on quarter in 2017, growth in euro area economic activity had slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2018, according to Eurostat’s latest release. This moderation had reflected a pull-back from the very high levels of growth observed in previous quarters, compounded by some temporary and supply-side factors, as well as weaker impetus from external trade. Incoming data since the April meeting had again surprised on the downside. In particular, declines in sentiment indicators – notably for the industrial sector – had continued in the second quarter of 2018, according to data available up to May, but were much smaller than the strong declines observed in the first quarter of the year. Levels were, however, still pointing to continued growth momentum. Accordingly, following a weaker than expected start to 2018, the economic expansion was expected to remain solid and broad-based, and to continue at a pace above potential. Favourable financing conditions, a robust labour market, and steady income and profit growth continued to support private demand.
