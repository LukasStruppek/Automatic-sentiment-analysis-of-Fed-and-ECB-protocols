Accordingly, the Governing Councilâ€™s communication needed, first, to highlight that, despite the moderation in activity at the start of this year, the medium-term outlook for growth remained solid and broad-based. Second, it should emphasise that risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook continued to be broadly balanced and that risks related to global factors, including the threat of increased protectionism, had become more prominent. Moreover, the risk of persistent heightened financial market volatility warranted monitoring. Third, it should stress that progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation had been substantial and that the continued underlying strength in the euro area economy provided grounds to be confident that the sustained convergence of inflation to the inflation aim would continue in the period ahead, even after a gradual winding-down of the net asset purchases.
