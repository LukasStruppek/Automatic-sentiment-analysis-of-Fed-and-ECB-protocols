In foreign exchange markets, the euro had depreciated against the US dollar, effectively reversing the strong appreciation observed earlier in the year. All in all, this period had coincided with a general strengthening of the US dollar, not only against the euro, reportedly explained by cyclical divergence between the United States and the rest of the G10, changes in relative equity performance and widening short-term interest rate differentials. Mr Cœuré concluded his introduction by recalling that changes in funding conditions in US dollars had been a very significant development at the end of 2017 and into 2018, but that the LIBOR-OIS spread had been narrowing more recently.
