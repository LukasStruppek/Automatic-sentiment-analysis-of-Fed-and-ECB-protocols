There was wide agreement among members that an ample degree of monetary stimulus was still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. As remaining uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook still called for caution, it was widely felt that monetary policy had to remain patient, prudent and persistent. Accordingly, it was argued that credible and effective forward guidance should be provided on the use of the remaining policy instruments, notably reinvestments and the evolution of policy interest rates, in order to accompany the sustained convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim. At the same time, it was considered necessary to retain sufficient flexibility and optionality for monetary policy in the period ahead, and the importance of data-dependency in determining the ECB’s policy stance was underlined.
