With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by MrÂ Praet in his introduction that, in spite of the recent moderation in activity, the incoming information remained consistent with continued solid and broad-based economic growth in the euro area. However, the short-term growth outlook was widely regarded as subject to some downside risks and uncertainties, notably related to the threat of increased protectionism, geopolitical tensions and renewed financial market risks in the euro area. Nevertheless, risks to the growth outlook were still assessed to remain broadly balanced in the medium term. Overall, the underlying strength of the economy, together with well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations and increasingly emerging price pressures, provided grounds for confidence that inflation would continue to move along a sustained adjustment path in the period ahead, even after a gradual winding-down of the net asset purchases.
