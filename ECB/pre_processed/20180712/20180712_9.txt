These developments were also reflected in the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which projected real GDP growth at 2.1% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. Compared with the March 2018 ECB staff projections, real GDP growth had been revised down for the first quarter of 2018 and was left broadly unchanged thereafter. The June projections were slightly below other available forecasts for 2018, probably reflecting the inclusion of up-to-date but weaker data releases, while falling within the range of forecasts for the remainder of the horizon.
