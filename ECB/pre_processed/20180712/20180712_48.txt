The anticipation of the end of the net purchases by the year-end was seen to be fully consistent with previous communication by the Governing Council, which had made the horizon of the net asset purchases conditional on the extent of progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation. Accordingly, with the substantial progress achieved, as also reflected in the inflation outlook contained in the recent Eurosystem staff projections, announcing the end of net purchases was widely regarded as following the gradual and predictable pattern of past recalibrations of the monetary policy stance, including the removal of the APP easing bias and the previous gradual reductions in the monthly pace of net asset purchases.
