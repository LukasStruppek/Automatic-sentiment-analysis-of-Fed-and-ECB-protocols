Turning to money and credit, money growth had moderated in the first quarter of 2018 and stood at 3.9% in April, in the context of lower APP purchase volumes. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector had meanwhile remained on a path of moderate expansion. In April the annual growth rate of loans to NFCs had stood at 3.3%, unchanged from the previous month, while the annual growth rate of loans to households was also stable at 2.9%. Lending continued to be supported by favourable financing conditions, with the composite cost of borrowing for NFCs and for households remaining close to historical lows.
