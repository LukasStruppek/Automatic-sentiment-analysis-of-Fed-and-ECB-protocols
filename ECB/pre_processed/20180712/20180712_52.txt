The enhanced forward guidance on policy rates via explicit date-based and state-contingent elements was seen to provide greater clarity on the future path of policy interest rates, thereby anchoring policy rate expectations more firmly to support the financial conditions underpinning a continued convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim. The strengthening of the forward guidance on the ECB’s policy rates was viewed as underlining their pivotal role as the tool of choice for adjusting the monetary policy stance in the future. In this regard, reference was made to the developments in policy rate expectations over recent months, which already indicated the market’s perception of the predominant role of the policy rates as the instrument for steering and communicating the monetary policy stance.
