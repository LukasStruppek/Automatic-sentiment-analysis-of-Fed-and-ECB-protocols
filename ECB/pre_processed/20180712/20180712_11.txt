In the June 2018 Eurosystem staff projections, headline inflation was expected to stand at 1.7% in each year of the projection period. Compared with the March 2018 ECB staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised up notably, by 0.3 percentage point, for 2018 and 2019. HICP inflation excluding energy and food had been revised up slightly for 2019 and 2020. Compared with other forecasts, the inflation projection was above that of most other institutions for 2018-19, on account of the latest developments in oil prices, but broadly in line for 2020.
