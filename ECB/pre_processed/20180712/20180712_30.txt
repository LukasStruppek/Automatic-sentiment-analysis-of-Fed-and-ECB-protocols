Regarding the external environment, members concurred that the outlook for global activity remained robust, even if recent global trade indicators pointed to a modest deceleration in the first months of 2018. The picture of a continued global economic expansion was also reflected in the June projections, which foresaw global activity (excluding the euro area) growing at a broadly unchanged pace compared with the March projections. While the expected upward impact of fiscal stimulus in the United States remained in place, geopolitical risks had not abated and trade tensions were considered to have become more likely. In particular, concerns were expressed about the possibility that such tensions could lead to a more general decline in confidence throughout the global economy, beyond any direct effects from the imposition of tariffs. Against this background, the balance of risks to the global economic expansion continued to be assessed as tilted to the downside.
