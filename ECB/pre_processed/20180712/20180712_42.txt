The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 was proceeding, with growth in loans to NFCs and to households unchanged. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continued to significantly support credit flows and favourable borrowing conditions for firms and households across the euro area. In particular, reference was made to the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), which had provided incentives for lending to the real economy and were seen to have contributed notably to the increase in credit growth, even exceeding initial expectations somewhat. In this context, it was remarked that credit growth in the second-largest euro area economy had reached rates of more than 5% for loans both to households and to NFCs, which had triggered the introduction of a counter-cyclical capital buffer for banks as a macroprudential policy measure in that economy.
