On the basis of this assessment, members expressed unanimous support for the monetary policy proposal put forward by Mr Praet in his introduction. This included confirmation of continued net asset purchases under the APP at the current monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of September 2018 and the anticipation that, after September, subject to incoming data confirming the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation outlook, the monthly net asset purchases would be reduced to €15 billion until the end of December 2018 and would then end. At the same time, it was also widely agreed that monetary policy accommodation had to remain ample, which called for confirming the forward guidance on the reinvestment of the principal payments from maturing securities for an extended period of time, while providing greater clarity on the expected future course of policy interest rates by enhancing the forward guidance on rates through explicit date-based and state-contingent elements. This entailed the expectation that policy rates would remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remained aligned with the Governing Council’s current expectations of a sustained adjustment path.
