Regarding the external environment, global indicators remained consistent with a steady expansion of economic activity, despite some softening of global trade. At the same time, inflation dynamics continued to be modest. Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area had remained stable in April, while inflation excluding food and energy had slowed marginally to 1.9%. Since the April monetary policy meeting, Brent crude oil prices had risen further – by 1.8% in US dollar terms – to stand at USD 74.8 per barrel on 12 June. Over the same horizon, non-oil commodity prices had remained broadly unchanged, while the euro had depreciated against the US dollar (-3.5%) and, to a lesser extent, in nominal effective terms (-0.9%).
