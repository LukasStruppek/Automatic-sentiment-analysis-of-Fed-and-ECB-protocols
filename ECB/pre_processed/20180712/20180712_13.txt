Financial conditions had remained broadly stable, despite heightened bond market volatility in some countries. There had been material declines in euro area bank bond and share prices, but non-financial corporate debt and equity markets were little changed overall. Euro area equity markets had remained supported by robust corporate profitability. The overall cost of financing for euro area firms had remained very favourable. The nominal cost of external financing for non-financial corporations (NFCs) was estimated to have changed only marginally since the April monetary policy meeting, as a falling cost of equity was partly offset by an increase in the cost of market-based debt.
