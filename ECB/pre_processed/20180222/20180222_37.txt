With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction. Annual euro area HICP inflation had declined to 1.4% in December 2017, compared with 1.5% in November. This decline mainly reflected developments in energy prices. Annual HICP inflation excluding food and energy had remained stable, at 0.9%, in December 2017, unchanged from the previous two months but slightly below the levels recorded in mid-2017, with the outlook for measures of underlying inflation considered to be broadly unchanged.
