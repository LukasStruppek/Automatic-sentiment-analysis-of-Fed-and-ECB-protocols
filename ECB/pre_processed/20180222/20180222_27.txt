In terms of the main components of demand, private consumption growth remained strong, supported by rising employment. Business investment was strengthening on the back of very favourable financing conditions, as well as improving corporate profitability and solid demand. Housing investment had also improved further in recent quarters. Domestic demand prospects were also underpinned by continued improvements in household and corporate sector balance sheets, facilitated by the ECBâ€™s monetary policy measures. Meanwhile, the broad-based global expansion was providing impetus to euro area exports.
