A number of remarks were made about recent exchange rate developments. While the euro exchange rate was not a target of ECB policy, movements in the exchange rate were deemed important insofar as they affected the outlook for growth and inflation in the euro area. It was also recalled from earlier Governing Council discussions that it was important to take into account the main factors behind the euroâ€™s appreciation, as the impact on activity and prices of a change in the exchange rate differed depending on the underlying causes.
