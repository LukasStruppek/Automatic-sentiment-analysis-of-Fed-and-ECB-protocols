Real private consumption had increased by 0.4% quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2017, after second quarter growth of 0.6%, continuing to benefit from solid growth in labour income and the low saving ratio. The strength of the labour market expansion was confirmed, with employment in the euro area increasing by 1.7% in the third quarter of 2017 in year-on-year terms. Since the trough in the second quarter of 2013, the number of people employed had increased by 7.4 million. Monthly trade data for extra-euro area goods exports suggested that the external impetus to euro area activity remained solid. Moreover, survey indicators also signalled ongoing strong export dynamics in the near term.
