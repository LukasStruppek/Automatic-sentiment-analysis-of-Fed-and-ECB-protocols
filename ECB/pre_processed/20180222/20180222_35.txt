Concerns were also expressed about recent statements in the international arena about exchange rate developments and, more broadly, the overall status of international relations. The importance of adhering to agreed statements on the exchange rate was emphasised, such as that included in the October 2017 communiqué of the 36th meeting of the IMF’s International Monetary and Financial Committee, which stated that excessive volatility or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse implications for economic and financial stability, and that members would refrain from competitive devaluations and would not target their exchange rates for competitive purposes.
