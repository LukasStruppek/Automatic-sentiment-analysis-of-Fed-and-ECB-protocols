With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction. Broad money (M3) had continued to expand at a robust pace. The gradual recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector, visible since the start of 2014, was proceeding amid a further pick-up in the growth of loans to NFCs and households. The expansion in credit continued to be supported by very favourable borrowing costs for firms and households across the euro area. It was nonetheless noted that deleveraging in the non-financial private sectors had progressed further according to various measures. This was seen as reassuring for the credit outlook and also from a financial stability perspective. Reference was also made to evidence from the bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2017, which indicated that loan growth continued to be supported by increasing demand and a further easing in overall lending conditions.
