The discrepancy, also observed in other major economies, between the ongoing expansion in economic activity and relatively subdued inflation dynamics was again highlighted. On a more positive note, it was pointed out that underlying measures of inflation had so far remained stable despite the appreciation of the exchange rate. It was furthermore noted that, according to the December 2017 Eurosystem staff projections, annual HICP inflation excluding food and energy would reach 1.8% in 2020, while in the period prior to the financial crisis its average increase had been around 1.5%. However, a remark was made that, in the absence of persistent positive contributions to price developments from food and energy components in the future, underlying inflation would need to be higher than its pre-crisis average if the ECB was to meet its inflation aim on a sustained basis.
