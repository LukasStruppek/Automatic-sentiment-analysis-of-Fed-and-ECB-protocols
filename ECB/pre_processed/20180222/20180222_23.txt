Looking ahead, the Governing Council would continue to assess progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation. As previously communicated, its assessment was based on three criteria: first, inflation should be on a path to reach levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, and there should be no doubt about the commitment to reach this aim; second, the range of likely outcomes around that path should be reasonably contained; and, third, the path should be maintained even in less supportive monetary policy conditions. Once the Governing Council judged that these criteria were met, net asset purchases would expire in line with the stated forward guidance. From that point in time, the evolution of inflation would remain conditional on the reinvestment of principal payments continuing for an extended period of time and on policy rates remaining at their present levels well past the end of net asset purchases.
