Part of the exchange rate appreciation could be related to more positive sentiment towards the euro area, resulting from improvements in the euro area economy. It was argued that an exchange rate appreciation linked to positive developments in domestic demand could be expected to have a lower pass-through to inflation, as firms would likely use the strength of the economic situation as an opportunity to rebuild their profit margins, which they had reduced during the crisis. However, more recently the euroâ€™s appreciation also reflected other factors, including communication on exchange rates and on the monetary policy outlook across major currency areas. In such cases, the pass-through to inflation could be stronger.
