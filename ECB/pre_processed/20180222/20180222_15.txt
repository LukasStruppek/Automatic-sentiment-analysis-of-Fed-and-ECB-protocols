Robust monetary dynamics had continued in November, with annual growth in the broad monetary aggregate M3 hovering around 5% since the start of the APP. The gradual recovery in loan growth had also continued. This development had been driven mainly by an increase in the annual growth of loans to NFCs, while the growth of loans to households remained broadly stable. Credit developments continued to be supported by low bank lending rates for NFCs and households. According to the euro area bank lending survey results for the fourth quarter of 2017, credit standards had eased for loans to households, while they had remained broadly unchanged for loans to enterprises. Loan demand had continued to increase across all categories.
