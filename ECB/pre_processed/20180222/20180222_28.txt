Members exchanged views about developments in the labour market and the degree of labour market slack remaining in the euro area. In particular, while further positive labour market developments were acknowledged – with employment and hours worked continuing to increase – attention was drawn to the fact that hours worked had not yet returned to their pre-crisis level. It was suggested that lower average hours worked relative to the pre-crisis period could be interpreted as evidence of continued labour market slack.
