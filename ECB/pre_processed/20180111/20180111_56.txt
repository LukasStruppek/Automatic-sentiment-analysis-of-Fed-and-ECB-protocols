Overall, it was seen as important to reiterate the October policy decisions, to underline the Governing Council’s commitment to its price stability objective and to reaffirm that an ample degree of monetary stimulus remained necessary for inflation to converge towards the Governing Council’s aim. It was again underlined that this stimulus was provided by the Governing Council’s entire policy package, notably the additional net asset purchases decided in October, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and by the forward guidance on key interest rates.
