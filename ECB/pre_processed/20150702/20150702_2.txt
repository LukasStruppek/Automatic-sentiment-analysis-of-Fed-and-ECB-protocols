Regarding developments in the euro area bond markets, the period since the April monetary policy meeting had been characterised by a rise in yields, led by German government bonds. Since December 2013, when the German ten-year government bond yielded 2%, yields had been on a virtually uninterrupted downward trend. On 17 April 2015 they had reached 0.05%, their lowest ever intraday level. At the end of April and in the first half of May, the German ten-year government bond yield had, however, risen substantially, touching intraday highs close to 0.78% on 7 and 14 May. Yield changes had been most pronounced in long-term maturities, leading to a significant steepening of the German yield curve. Since those moves, the German ten-year bond yield had declined somewhat and on 1 June had closed at 0.54%. The yields on other euro area government bonds had also been under upward pressure. During the first two weeks of the bond sell-off, yields had generally increased by less than those on German government bonds, but yield spreads had widened during the second half of May.
