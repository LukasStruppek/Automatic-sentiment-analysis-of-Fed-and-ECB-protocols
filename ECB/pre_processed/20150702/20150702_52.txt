Regarding the need to assess the recent sharp fluctuations in financial market prices from a monetary policy perspective, as suggested by Mr Praet in his introduction, there was broad agreement that the recent partial reversal of previous strong increases in financial market prices was of a multifaceted nature and was likely to be related to the three factors mentioned by Mr Cœuré, namely a reappraisal of the economic outlook by market participants, the observed recovery in inflation expectations since early 2015 and a number of technical market factors. Recent financial market developments had been dominated by sharp movements in government bonds, accompanied by a fall in equities and a stronger euro, which, however, on balance, were not assessed to have materially altered the economic outlook for the euro area. On this basis, it was widely felt that it was advisable for the Governing Council to look through recent financial market volatility. As stated on previous occasions, if there were factors that led to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy, or if the outlook for growth and inflation were to materially change, the features of the monetary policy programmes in place would have to be reviewed. There was, however, no reason to do so now.
