It was underlined that the degree of forecast uncertainty tended to increase with the length of the projection horizon, and it remained to be seen whether inflation would increase as strongly as projected by staff. In particular, the size of the output gap and the speed at which it closed would have important implications for the inflation rate in 2017. Two issues were noted in this context. First, while it had to be recognised that there was substantial measurement uncertainty, the output gap in the June Eurosystem staff projections was assessed to close somewhat faster than the estimates of some international institutions. Second, since 2010, core inflation in the euro area had been around 1Â¼%, with movements in headline inflation being driven primarily by developments in the non-core components of the HICP. The Governing Council should therefore not draw conclusions prematurely, in particular as regards the price outlook for 2017, but rather continue its close monitoring and assessment of underlying price trends.
