First, several indicators of euro area economic activity and sentiment released in the second half of April had increased, thereby supporting expectations that the economy was gradually picking up. Second, the recovery in euro area inflation expectations and inflation data had also started to attract analysts’ attention, including the HICP release on 2 June, which was associated with sizeable market moves. That said, a change in fundamentals could not explain such an abrupt correction in yields. Accordingly, third, technical factors in the markets were also likely to have contributed. Gross bond issuance by euro area governments in May had been high, with hardly any redemptions. Furthermore, many investors’ positioning had reportedly been one-directional, owing to the conviction that yields would remain at the prevailing levels or would even decline further. Once the markets had started to turn around, the unwinding of investors’ positions had been very quick and pronounced. In this environment, volatility had increased substantially over the period between the end of April and the end of May. Inter alia, market analysts had pointed to relatively poor market liquidity conditions as significantly exacerbating the rise in bond yields, which had been linked to the general positioning of the market and to the absence of some traditionally active investors.
