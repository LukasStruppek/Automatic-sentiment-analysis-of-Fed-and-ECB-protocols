There was broad agreement about the important role of investment and a resumption of risk-taking in the real economy for a sustained recovery, as well as about the connection between a pick-up in investment and an improvement in profit margins. While it was recognised that cyclical developments pointed to an upturn in profits, it was possible that downward pressures on profits might continue, notably owing to the impact of globalisation. On a future occasion, it would be worthwhile for the members of the Governing Council to discuss in more detail what was driving profit developments, including evidence on the pricing power of euro area firms in domestic and foreign markets.
