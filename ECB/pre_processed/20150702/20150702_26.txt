Summing up, Mr Praet noted that the latest data confirmed that the euro area economy was growing at a moderate pace and that, looking ahead, the economic recovery was expected to broaden in line with what had already been expected in the March 2015 ECB staff projections. On the nominal side, euro area HICP inflation had continued on its upward path and inflation expectations remained broadly unchanged. Cross-checking the results of the economic analysis with evidence from the monetary analysis, money and credit dynamics had strengthened further in a context of favourable financial conditions and remained consistent with the outlook of a slowly improving environment for euro area economic growth and inflation. At present it was judged that recent strong fluctuations in financial market prices had not materially altered this picture, while close monitoring and continuous assessment were warranted from a monetary policy perspective.
