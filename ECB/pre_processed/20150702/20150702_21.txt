Regarding money and credit, the recovery in broad money growth and loan dynamics had continued, although only gradually in the case of the latter. The annual growth rate of M3 had increased to 5.3% in April from 4.6% in March. This increase had been mostly driven by the narrow monetary aggregate M1, up to 10.5% in April from 10.0% in March, reflecting the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid components of money.
