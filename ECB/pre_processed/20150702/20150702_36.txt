Members also referred to developments in potential growth and the degree of slack in the economy. In this context, it was underlined that, even if the output gap was closing over the projection horizon, output growth in the euro area was developing below its pre-crisis long-term trend, owing in part to past low investment. The euro area was thus experiencing a cyclical, rather than a structural, recovery. At the same time, the well-known uncertainty surrounding estimates of the output gap was recalled, which supported a cautious interpretation of the output gap. This caution was also seen to be applicable to estimates of the structural level of unemployment.
