As regards longer-term inflation expectations, market-based measures had broadly stabilised at higher levels, albeit displaying some volatility. For instance, the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead stood at 1.8% in early June 2015. Shorter-term market-based measures, such as forward inflation-linked swap rates with maturities of up to five years, remained broadly unchanged overall since the April monetary policy meeting.
