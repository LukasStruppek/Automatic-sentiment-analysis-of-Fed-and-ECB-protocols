With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction. Reference was made to Eurostat’s flash estimate, according to which euro area annual HICP inflation had risen to 0.3% in May 2015, the first positive rate since late 2014, reflecting higher annual growth rates for all main components of the HICP. While the outcome in May was slightly above market expectations, it was in line with the June Eurosystem staff projections. However, the annual rate of HICP inflation excluding food and energy, which increased to 0.9% in May from 0.6% in April, was slightly higher than expected. While it was important to remain cautious, as these data related to only one month, it was nevertheless considered to be a positive development.
