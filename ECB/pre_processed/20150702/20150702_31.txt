A number of remarks were made regarding both the outlook and the risks for the international environment. While global growth was expected to increase gradually, growth in global trade had experienced a slowdown at the start of the year and there had been some weakening in the global recovery. Geopolitical uncertainties continued to prevail. There was therefore a downside risk to trade, which in the case of the euro area had, to some extent, been compensated for by past movements in the exchange rate. At the same time, it was suggested that the external environment might be weak for some time, while the positive effects of the lower exchange rate on euro area growth would gradually dissipate.
