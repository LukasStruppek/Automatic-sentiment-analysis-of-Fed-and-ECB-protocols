The inflation outlook embedded in the staff projections was also seen to be based on a fairly strong pass-through of the past depreciation of the exchange rate and to depend on a future upward path of oil prices. As regards the former, different views were expressed by members. It was pointed out that, over the past 10-15 years, the pass-through of the exchange rate had been slower following large movements. The pass-through had also been slow so far for the euro area. A pricing-to-market strategy on the part of euro area exporters, which implied higher euro prices following the depreciation of the euro, represented a low pass-through to importing countries. At the same time, it could be argued that this was not that surprising, as exporting firms needed to see where the exchange rate would stabilise. It would take some time for foreign prices to adjust. In the meantime, margins were improving and the potential for having more competitive products on markets abroad was a positive indicator for the future. Many euro area countries would, over time, benefit through their exports of goods and services.
