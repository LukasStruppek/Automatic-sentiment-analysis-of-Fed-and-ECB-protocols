The robust recovery in the most liquid components of money was seen to reflect a more pronounced preference for liquidity given the low opportunity cost of holding monetary instruments. As a result, there had been a substitution within MFI liabilities towards short-term instruments included in M3 owing to the low incentives for the money-holding sector to invest in alternative assets, as their returns were not high enough to compensate for the loss of transaction services that money offered. In addition, the most recent acceleration in broad money growth was starting to reflect the effects of the Eurosystemâ€™s asset purchases from the euro area money-holding sector, in particular via increased holdings of monetary deposits by non-monetary financial intermediaries, especially investment funds. All in all, caution was still seen to be warranted as regards possible monetary policy interpretations of recent favourable dynamics in money growth.
