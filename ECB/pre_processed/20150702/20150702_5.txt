Looking ahead, expanding the size of the Eurosystem balance sheet toward levels observed at the beginning of 2012, which had been the stated objective of the purchase programmes and the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), appeared to be within reach. With respect to liquidity developments in the banking system, excess liquidity had doubled since the start of the PSPP purchases. The higher excess liquidity had continued to exert downward pressure on short-term euro money market rates, as evidenced by several new all-time lows in various market segments, illustrating a stronger pass-through of the accommodative monetary policy stance into money market rates. Having begun in the wholesale markets, negative rates were now spreading to the retail markets through the EURIBOR, which did not seem to be creating major disruptions in contracts. However, the further narrowing of the spread between the overnight money market rate and the rate on the deposit facility was becoming a disincentive for banks to lend into the market as opposed to them depositing excess cash at the central bank with potentially an adverse impact on market functioning.
