With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction. Based on recent data and projections, the previous outlook for the euro area was broadly confirmed with regard to both activity and prices. The economic recovery was expected to proceed at a moderate but steady pace, underpinned by the comprehensive package of monetary policy decisions taken in early March 2016. At the same time, price pressures continued to be weak, with inflation rates likely to remain very low or negative in the next few months, before picking up in the second half of 2016. Going forward, some additional stimulus, beyond the impetus already taken into account, was expected from the monetary policy measures still to be implemented, which would contribute to further rebalancing the risks to the outlook for growth and inflation. At the same time, the Governing Council would continue to monitor closely the evolution of the outlook for price stability to ensure, in particular, that the very low inflation environment did not become entrenched in second-round effects on wage and price setting.
