Fourth, additional stimulus was expected from the measures still to be implemented, beyond the impetus already taken into account. Both TLTRO II and the CSPP were seen as important measures that could be expected to impact the real economy directly. With regard to the series of TLTRO II operations, it was recalled that the earlier operations had been instrumental in turning around the credit cycle in the euro area and in reducing fragmentation, and that the new operations should also help to support lending and, ultimately, inflation expectations. It was underlined that both the gross and the net take-up would matter from a monetary policy perspective, as TLTRO II allowed banks to substitute more expensive shorter-term financing with cheaper long-term funds, over and above any net impact on excess liquidity, which also mattered in conjunction with the negative deposit rate. However, the actual take-up was not to be seen as the sole measure of success, as the TLTROs also contained an important “insurance” element to cater for uncertainty and adverse contingencies.
