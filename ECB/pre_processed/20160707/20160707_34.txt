Considering the arguments in more detail, members discussed the outlook and risks for the external environment. It was noted that, in the latest Eurosystem staff projections, the prospects for both global growth and global trade throughout the projection horizon had been revised downwards compared with the March 2016 ECB staff projections. Attention was drawn to the fact that this marked the continuation of a long sequence of downward revisions to the external outlook. It was also observed that global trade was again expected to grow less than global activity in 2016, as in 2015, and that in the past a rate of growth of global trade below that of global activity had been a precursor to a downturn in global economic activity. At the same time, it was highlighted that there were important composition effects behind the weaker developments in trade growth observed since the financial crisis. In particular, it was underlined that stronger growth in emerging market economies relative to advanced economies in recent years was an important factor accounting for the lower trade elasticity seen since the crisis, as the trade openness of emerging market economies was lower than that of advanced economies.
