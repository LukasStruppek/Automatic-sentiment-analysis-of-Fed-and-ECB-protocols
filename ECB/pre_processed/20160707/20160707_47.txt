With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction. Broad money (M3) had continued to grow at a robust pace in April 2016, which, as in previous months, was supported by growth in its most liquid components. Loan dynamics had followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014, with the annual rates of change of loans to non-financial corporations and of loans to households (adjusted for loans sales and securitisation) both having remained broadly stable in April 2016.
