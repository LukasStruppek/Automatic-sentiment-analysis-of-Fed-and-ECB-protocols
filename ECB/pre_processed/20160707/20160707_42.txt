A number of comments were made regarding expected developments in headline inflation. It was noted that, in the projections, a significant increase in overall HICP inflation, from 0.2% to 1.3%, was expected between 2016 and 2017. The increase in inflation largely reflected the path of energy prices. It was suggested that oil prices might rise even more than assumed in the projection baseline, as it could be argued that the impact of changes in the supply of oil would take some time to be reflected in oil prices. At the same time, it was recognised that the factors affecting the production of oil included some temporary supply disruptions, which could imply that there might also be some downside risks to oil prices.
