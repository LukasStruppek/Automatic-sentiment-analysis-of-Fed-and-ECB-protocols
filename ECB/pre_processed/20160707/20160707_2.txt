In the United States, market expectations of a rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had firmed since the Governing Councilâ€™s April monetary policy meeting. A 25 basis point rate hike was fully priced in by the end of the year. US Treasury yields had remained relatively stable at the long end of the curve, while the nominal effective exchange rate of the US dollar had strengthened. US equity markets had continued to perform well, with the S&P; 500 trading slightly below its all-time high.
