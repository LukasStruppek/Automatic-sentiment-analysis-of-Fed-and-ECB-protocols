Producer prices for domestic sales had not changed significantly. While past rises in import prices for non-energy goods and a slight improvement in economic conditions should, in the meantime, have exerted upward pressure on producer prices, available data suggested that these factors could have been countered by lower commodity prices and subdued wage growth. It appeared that producers were content to maintain prices at their current levels, possibly facilitating some recovery in profit margins if, on balance, input costs had declined. Survey data also pointed to continued subdued price pressures.
