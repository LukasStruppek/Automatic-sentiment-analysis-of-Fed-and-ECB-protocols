Members exchanged views on the latest developments in inflation expectations. Market-based inflation expectations for the euro area had remained low, but the slight increase since the Governing Councilâ€™s April monetary policy meeting was noted, with the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead currently standing just below 1.5%. However, the decoupling of inflation expectations from oil price developments and the fact that market-based inflation expectations had not picked up from their low levels despite the increase in oil prices remained a matter of concern. At the same time, it could be argued that the projected pick-up in headline inflation would help to avoid second-round effects. Moreover, doubts were again expressed about relying too much on market-based measures of inflation expectations, which had deviated strongly from survey-based measures.
