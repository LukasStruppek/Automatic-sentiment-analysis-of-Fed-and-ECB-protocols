While the gross indebtedness of non-financial corporations (NFCs) in relation to their gross operating surplus had remained at a relatively high level, firms had increased their retained earnings and improved their access to external financing. At the same time, corporate debt-to-equity ratios had declined strongly since early 2009, driven by the sharp increase in equity prices and the weak growth in debt in recent years. In addition, NFCsâ€™ net interest payments had declined from 9% to 2% of gross operating surplus between the end of 2008 and the fourth quarter of 2015.
