According to the June Eurosystem staff projections, HICP inflation was expected to rebound from 0.2% in 2016 to 1.3% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, broadly in line with recent forecasts from other international institutions and the private sector, including the OECD forecasts for the euro area, which had just been released. In comparison with the March 2016 ECB staff projections, the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised slightly upwards for 2016, reflecting recent oil price increases, and had remained unchanged for 2017 and 2018.
