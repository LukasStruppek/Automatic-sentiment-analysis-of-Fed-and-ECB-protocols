With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction. The recovery of the euro area economy was expected to continue, led by domestic demand and supported by the pass-through of the ECBâ€™s monetary policy measures, as well as by still relatively low oil prices and a slightly expansionary fiscal stance in 2016. In particular, investment continued to be supported by favourable financing conditions together with improving corporate profitability, while consumption was supported by higher real household disposable income, related to sustained employment gains and low oil prices. Growth prospects were seen to be still dampened by headwinds stemming from the external environment, as well as by balance sheet adjustments in the non-financial and financial sectors. This assessment had also been reflected in the outlook for growth in the June 2016 Eurosystem staff projections, which broadly confirmed the outlook embedded in the March ECB staff projections. As regards the risk assessment, additional stimulus, beyond the impetus already taken into account, could be expected from the monetary policy measures still to be implemented, while a number of uncertainties persisted. On balance, the risks to the growth outlook were considered to remain tilted to the downside, but the balance of risks had improved.
