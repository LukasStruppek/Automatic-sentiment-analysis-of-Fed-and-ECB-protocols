Turning to price developments in the euro area, according to Eurostatâ€™s flash estimate annual HICP inflation had remained negative in May, at -0.1%, slightly up from its April level of -0.2%, mainly reflecting higher energy and services price inflation. Annual HICP inflation excluding food and energy had risen to 0.8% in May, up from 0.7% in April, although most measures of underlying inflation did not show a clear sign of an upward trend.
