With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction. Broad money (M3) had continued to increase at a robust pace in July 2016. As in previous months, annual growth in M3 had been mainly supported by its most liquid components and loan dynamics had continued on the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014.
