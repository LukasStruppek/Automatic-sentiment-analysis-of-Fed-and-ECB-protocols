Commenting in more detail on the outlook for and risks to the external environment, members noted that the latest staff projections did not contain a deterioration in the outlook for emerging market economies. At the same time, it was remarked that the staff projections had incorporated a substantial downward revision to euro area foreign demand, which largely reflected a lower growth and trade outlook for the United Kingdom in the wake of the referendum vote to leave the European Union. Members took note that the financial market reaction to the outcome of the referendum had been contained. There was also some evidence, from recent UK data releases, to suggest that the immediate effect on activity of the referendum result might be less negative than had been widely expected. At the same time, it was emphasised that there was considerable uncertainty surrounding the longer-term economic implications of the UK vote, as regards the impact both on the UK economy and on trade with the European Union. It was considered too early to say that the widely expected adverse effects on growth were overstated, while the monetary policy measures taken by the Bank of England, together with expectations of further policy measures, were seen as helping to buffer the adjustment of the UK economy. Thus, there remained a risk that, at some point, stronger downside effects of the UK decision to leave the European Union would manifest themselves. Overall, there was broad agreement that the outlook for the external environment continued to be uncertain and subject to downside risks.
