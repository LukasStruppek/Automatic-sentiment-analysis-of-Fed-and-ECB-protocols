However, it was also argued that there were good reasons to think that the past projection errors for inflation might not be repeated in the future. The impact of labour market reforms, which might have dampened wage pressures in the past, would fade over time and the effect of nominal rigidities, which had prevented sharp corrections in wages during the crisis and led to a more protracted wage adjustment, should also diminish. Moreover, there was a composition effect on wages, linked to job creation in low productivity and low wage sectors, which was unlikely to continue. It was also noted that oil prices were subject to considerable volatility and it was not easy to predict where they would stand in 2018. According to oil price futures, oil prices in 2018 would still be below their 2015 level. It could thus be argued that there was a risk that oil prices would be higher than assumed in the projections and that energy price inflation might increase more than currently projected.
