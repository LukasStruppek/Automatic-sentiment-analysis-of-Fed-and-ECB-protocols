Against this background, members again stressed that monetary policy on its own was not sufficient for a self-sustaining recovery, and that there was a need for other policy areas to contribute much more decisively in supporting economic activity and potential growth. Structural reforms were necessary in all euro area countries, and implementation needed to be stepped up substantially in order to reduce the level of structural unemployment and to raise potential growth. The focus should be on actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of adequate public infrastructure. Higher public and private investment was considered important to raise productivity growth. The swift and effective implementation of structural reforms would not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area, but would also make the euro area more resilient to external shocks.
