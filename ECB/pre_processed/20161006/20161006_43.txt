Members also considered recent developments in inflation expectations. It was highlighted that survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, such as the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, were broadly unchanged for the period five years ahead, at around 1.8%. However, while the average of point forecasts was stable, the Survey of Professional Forecasters also provided a probability distribution around the point forecasts which remained tilted to the downside. There had been a further decline in market-based inflation expectations for the euro area since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead having fallen to around 1.3%. This warranted close monitoring. It was also noted, however, that the probability of deflation had not increased and that market expectations were affected by international, as well as domestic, developments. Moreover, it could not be ruled out that there might be some small positive effects on longer-term market expectations if actual inflation started to increase in the coming months.
