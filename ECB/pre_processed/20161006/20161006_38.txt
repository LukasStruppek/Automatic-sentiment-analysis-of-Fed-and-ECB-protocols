Turning to fiscal policy, members highlighted the need for compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union and reiterated that full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact over time and across countries remained crucial for confidence in the fiscal framework, which was increasingly being challenged. Concerns were expressed with regard to recent decisions at the European level that cast doubt on the functioning of the Pact. At the same time, it was also recalled that a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies could support the economic recovery, as could the use of fiscal space, where available. It was stressed that the composition of government expenditure was at least as important as its size.
