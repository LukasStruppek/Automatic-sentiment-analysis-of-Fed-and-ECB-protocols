Members stressed that the effects of the monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 were continuing to filter through to support borrowing conditions for firms and households and, thereby, credit flows across the euro area. In particular, the continued easing in market-based financing conditions, including banks’ funding conditions, together with strong competitive pressure among lenders, had all contributed to a further decline in bank lending rates, including vis-à-vis small and medium-sized enterprises. While the credit channel had continued to improve, bank loan dynamics still remained moderate overall despite the substantial degree of monetary accommodation. Therefore, given the banking system’s crucial importance for the transmission of monetary policy to the broader economy, developments in the bank lending channel continued to deserve close monitoring, as had been pointed out by Mr Praet in his introduction.
