As regards longer-term inflation expectations, survey-based measures had remained stable since the beginning of the year. According to the ECBâ€™s Survey of Professional Forecasters for the third quarter of 2016, average longer-term expectations for inflation five years ahead continued to stand at 1.8%. By contrast, looking at market-based inflation expectations, the euro area five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had decreased further, from 1.36% on 19 July 2016, to stand at 1.26% on 6 September. Financial market participants continued to assume that medium-term inflation would stay low, with the probability of inflation remaining between only 0% and 1.5% increasing again since the UK referendum. At the same time, deflation fears in the market appeared well contained and had not returned to the levels observed in late 2014 and early 2015.
