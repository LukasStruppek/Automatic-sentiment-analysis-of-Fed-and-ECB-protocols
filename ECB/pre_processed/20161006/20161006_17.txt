The total annual flow of external financing to euro area NFCs continued to strengthen in the second quarter of 2016. Current levels were comparable with those of 2005 and 2009, being mainly driven by the ample issuance of market debt. Together with the ongoing recovery in loans to NFCs from banks and non-banks, these developments pointed to improved access to external financing by both larger and smaller firms and were expected to provide further support to the ongoing euro area recovery.
