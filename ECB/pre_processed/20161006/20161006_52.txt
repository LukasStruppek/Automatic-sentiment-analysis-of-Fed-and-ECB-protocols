The comprehensive set of policy measures that had been adopted were seen as continuing to support favourable market and bank-based financing conditions. In particular, the recently commenced CSPP and TLTRO-II were providing further significant funding cost relief to both non-financial corporations and banks. Moreover, market fragmentation had, overall, diminished markedly, contributing to improvements in monetary policy transmission across the euro area. Reference was made to the ongoing reduction in emergency liquidity assistance to banks in vulnerable euro area countries and the continued decline in spreads across euro area credit markets. However, cross-country differences in spreads were also seen to reflect still prevailing differences in country-specific credit risk premia.
