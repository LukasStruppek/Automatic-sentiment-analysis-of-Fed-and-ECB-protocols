In considering the latest staff projections, members observed that the expected negative effect of the UK referendum outcome on the euro area economy via trade channels had been offset by other factors, notably a decline in government bond yields and a slightly lower effective exchange rate of the euro. It was underlined that the projections were based on exceptionally supportive financing conditions, which to a large extent reflected the ECBâ€™s accommodative monetary policy. It was also noted that market expectations of additional monetary policy measures by the ECB were reflected in the technical assumptions underlying the September 2016 staff projections for growth and inflation. This limited the extent to which the baseline was revised downwards. However, overall, the positive impact of these expectations on the baseline was assessed to be contained and had to be viewed in the context of the high degree of uncertainty which, in any case, surrounded the outlook for growth and inflation, including uncertainty about the impact of non-standard measures.
