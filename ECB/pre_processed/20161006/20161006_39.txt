With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction. Headline inflation was expected to start rising in the coming months, owing to upward base effects from energy prices and assumed oil price increases embedded in the futures curve. Over the projection horizon, inflation was expected to pick up further, supported by the ECBâ€™s monetary policy measures and in line with the projected economic recovery. This assessment was reflected in the September 2016 ECB staff projections, where the HICP inflation outlook was broadly unchanged in comparison with the June 2016 Eurosystem staff projections.
