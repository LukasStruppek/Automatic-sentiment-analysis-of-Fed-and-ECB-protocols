Ongoing structural challenges related to banksâ€™ balance sheets and the weakness in profitability continued to pose a risk to the transmission of monetary policy and the further recovery in credit dynamics. While bank earnings had been lower in the first quarter of 2016 than in the first quarter of 2015 (when banks had benefited from valuation gains associated with the launch of the expanded APP), net interest income had still been holding up relatively well. However, more recent indications pointed to a further decline in all three main revenue pillars, namely interest income, non-interest fee income and trading income. While this could, in part, be attributed to the low interest rate environment, lower bank earnings were also due to provisioning related to the still high level of non-performing loans in parts of the euro area banking sector and increased competition among banks. Looking ahead, further challenges could arise from regulatory and supervisory demands on banks in the coming months.
