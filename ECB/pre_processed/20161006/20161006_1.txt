Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 20-21 July 2016, sentiment in the financial markets had improved and volatility had declined. Global equity indices had fully recovered from the decline seen at the time of the UK referendum and, by early September, had risen to stand close to their highest levels in 2016, supported by better than expected economic news in some of the main economic regions and by expectations of further monetary policy easing. While the European bank equity index had been supported by the generally positive market sentiment through July and August, it remained below the levels seen at the start of the year. The release of the European Banking Authority’s stress test results had not had any significant impact on the performance of bank equities.
