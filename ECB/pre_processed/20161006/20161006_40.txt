In discussing expected developments in inflation, members noted that there was still no clear upward trend visible in measures of underlying inflation, which remained low. According to the latest staff projections, HICP inflation excluding food and energy and headline inflation were expected to converge in early 2017, at rates slightly above 1%. With regard to the prospect of a further increase in inflation beyond this period, it was suggested that an important role would probably be played by services price inflation, as non-energy industrial goods prices were likely to continue to be affected by globalisation and could therefore be expected to remain subdued. The expectation of higher services price inflation was supported by evidence linking developments in services prices with wage growth, and by the expectation of more dynamic wage developments. It would thus be important to continue to follow developments in wages closely. In this context, it was noted that the projections expected a further decline in the unemployment rate to be only gradual, which might understate the cyclical effect on the labour market of the ongoing recovery in activity.
