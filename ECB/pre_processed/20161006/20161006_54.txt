Overall, confidence was expressed that the monetary policy measures were continuing to provide effective support to the cyclical recovery and the upward path in inflation. This was also reflected in the September 2016 ECB staff projections, in which the measures taken in December 2015 and March 2016 were estimated to have a cumulated upward impact on real GDP growth of 0.6 percentage point and on inflation of 0.4 percentage point over the projection horizon. In this context, it was highlighted that the projected path of inflation was conditional on exceptionally supportive financing conditions, which to a large extent reflected the current accommodative monetary policy stance and prevailing market expectations about the future course of monetary policy.
