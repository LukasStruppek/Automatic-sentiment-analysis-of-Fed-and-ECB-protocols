Total investment had been flat in the second quarter, while domestic conditions remained, overall, supportive for investment. The latest quarterly European Commission Business Surveys that were released on 29 July showed that capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector had increased slightly and that demand had improved further to a level not seen since early 2012. However, falling confidence and export orders in total manufacturing suggested weaker business investment growth looking ahead. At the same time, low interest rates in the euro area significantly reduced debt servicing costs, thereby supporting the profitability of non-financial corporations (NFCs).
