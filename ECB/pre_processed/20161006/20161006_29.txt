With regard to the economic analysis, there was broad agreement among the members with the assessment, provided by Mr Praet in his introduction, of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area. Real GDP growth had continued in the second quarter, albeit at a lower rate than in the first quarter, in line with expectations. Recent data releases remained consistent with a continuation of the moderate economic recovery also in the third quarter. Looking further ahead, domestic demand in the euro area was expected to remain resilient, supported by still relatively low oil prices, as well as by the pass-through of the ECBâ€™s monetary policy measures. Growth prospects were seen to be dampened by continuing subdued foreign demand, partly related to the uncertainties surrounding the outcome of the UK referendum, as well as by the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. This assessment was reflected in the outlook for growth in the September 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections. Compared with the June 2016 Eurosystem staff projections, the growth outlook had been revised downwards slightly.
