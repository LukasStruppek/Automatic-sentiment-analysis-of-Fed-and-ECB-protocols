Producer price inflation for domestic sales of non-food consumer goods had remained unchanged at 0.0% in July. While some improvement in economic conditions had probably exerted upward pressure on producer prices, it had likely been offset by low commodity input prices. Looking ahead, signs of upward pressure came from the services sector. Moreover, selling price expectations had continued to show an upward trend, with the European Commission survey indicator standing above its long-term average since the beginning of 2016. Wage growth in the euro area had stabilised at a low level.
