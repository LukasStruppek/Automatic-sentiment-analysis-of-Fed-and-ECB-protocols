Members also discussed possible future challenges regarding the Eurosystem’s ability to source sufficient eligible bonds in the market under the APP and the request was made to the relevant Eurosystem committees to further evaluate the options to ensure smooth implementation of the programme. The view was widely shared that reassurance had to be provided about the Eurosystem’s ability to ensure the smooth implementation of the APP and its capacity to deliver on its commitment that the programme would run until March 2017, or beyond, if needed. It was underlined that the Governing Council could adjust the parameters of the programme at any time to achieve the intended amounts. There should be no doubt about the Governing Council’s determination to execute its asset purchases in line with its past decisions and to adopt further measures, if needed, to fulfil its price stability objective.
