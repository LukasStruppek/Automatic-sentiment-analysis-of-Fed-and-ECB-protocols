A number of remarks were made in relation to the risks surrounding the increase in inflation expected in the September 2016 staff projections. In particular, reference was made to the past sequence of over-predictions in the inflation projections, which was seen as a downside risk to the baseline. Concern was expressed that the standard models used to produce inflation forecasts were typically subject to mean-reversion, and it was noted that analysis of the inflation outlook using a range of Phillips curves suggested that the projections, although within a plausible range, could be considered optimistic. The remark was also made that persistently low inflation in the euro area might start to affect expectations and make it harder for countries to regain competitiveness via relative price and wage adjustment, as well as contribute to higher real interest rates and a higher real debt burden, thereby dampening economic growth and inflation prospects.
