Quarterly growth in private consumption had slowed in the second quarter, while labour markets had continued to improve and householdsâ€™ real disposable income had increased further. Employment had risen by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter and the euro area unemployment rate, at 10.1% in July, unchanged from June, had remained at its lowest level since August 2011. Surveys up to August 2016 suggested further labour market improvements in the period ahead.
