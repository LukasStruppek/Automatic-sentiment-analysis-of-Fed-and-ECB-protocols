Turning to the euro area, real GDP had increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2016, after 0.5% in the first quarter, with positive contributions from net exports and, to a lesser extent, domestic demand. The composite output PMI had stood, on average, at 53.1 in July and August, the same level as in the second quarter, while the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) had displayed a small decline as a result of a pronounced fall in August. Both indicators – the PMI and the ESI – remained above their respective long-term averages.
