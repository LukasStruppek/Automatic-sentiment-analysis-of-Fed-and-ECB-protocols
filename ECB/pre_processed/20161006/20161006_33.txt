When discussing the components of domestic spending, members observed that consumption was being supported by higher real household disposable income, related to sustained employment gains and still relatively low oil prices, while favourable financing conditions, together with improvements in corporate profitability and in the outlook for demand, should support a recovery in investment looking ahead. However, some concern was again expressed about the prospects for a pick-up in investment, also taking into account its weakness in the second quarter. Members felt that the reasons behind the hesitant recovery in business investment needed to be better understood in conjunction with persistently high corporate savings, the role of uncertainty and other factors, such as technology and demographic developments.
