With regard to financial conditions, the situation had remained broadly unchanged from the 20-21 July Governing Council meeting. The EONIA forward yield curve remained well below levels that had been observed in early June 2016, while the GDP-weighted average of ten-year euro area sovereign bond yields had mostly stayed between 0.5% and 0.6%. Moreover, financial market volatility had remained low and NFC equity indices were trading above levels that had prevailed at the beginning of June. At the same time, a further decline in corporate bond yields, amid rising monthly gross issuance of corporate bonds, had been observed since the announcement of the CSPP in March. The cost to euro area banks of debt funding had also continued to fall and to converge across countries towards very low levels. Moreover, banks had seen a further decrease in the cost of deposits and of Eurosystem funding, particularly via TLTRO-II. Bank lending rates to households and NFCs had continued to decline in the second quarter of 2016 and in July. At the same time, retail deposit rates across the euro area had stabilised at very low levels. Financing conditions for households and firms had improved slightly overall.
