Turning to the euro area, there was broad agreement with the growth outlook embodied in the September 2016 ECB staff projections. The latter confirmed that the moderate recovery in the euro area economy was ongoing, with only small downward revisions to the outlook for 2017 and 2018, which were related to external, rather than domestic, factors. It was noted that the latest data for the euro area were consistent with an ongoing economic recovery, with business and consumer confidence remaining robust over the summer months. It was highlighted that the euro area had recorded positive quarter-on-quarter growth rates for more than three years, starting in the second quarter of 2013, which was evidence of the resilience of the euro area recovery to global economic and political uncertainty.
