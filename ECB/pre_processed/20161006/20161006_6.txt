Global growth continued to be sluggish. The global composite output Purchasing Managersâ€™ Index (PMI) had risen to 51.6 in August, from 51.5 in July, on the back of a slightly stronger expansion in both the manufacturing and services sectors, although developments had remained mixed both across and within advanced economies and emerging market economies. In the United Kingdom, following the referendum outcome in June, short-term indicators had been more resilient than previously expected, while uncertainty remained high as regards the longer-term economic outlook.
