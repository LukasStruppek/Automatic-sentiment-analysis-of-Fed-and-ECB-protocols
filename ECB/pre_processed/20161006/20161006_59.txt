As regards communication, members widely agreed with the proposals presented by Mr Praet in his introduction. Confidence had to be conveyed in the effectiveness of the ECB’s monetary policy measures and the state of the euro area economy, its resilience to global uncertainty and the baseline scenario for growth and inflation. In the light of the prevailing uncertainties, it was also seen as important to reiterate that the Governing Council was monitoring economic and financial market developments very closely and that it was determined to preserve the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation that was necessary to secure a return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Finally, great emphasis had to be placed on the Governing Council’s willingness, capacity and ability to act, if warranted, to achieve its objective by using all the instruments available within its mandate.
