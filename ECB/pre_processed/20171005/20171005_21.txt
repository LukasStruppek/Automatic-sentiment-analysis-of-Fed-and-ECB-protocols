The ongoing economic expansion supported confidence that inflation would gradually head towards levels in line with the Governing Council’s inflation aim. Nonetheless, the September 2017 ECB staff projections indicated a somewhat slower path for inflation convergence than the June projections, on account of the stronger euro. While measures of underlying inflation had ticked up moderately in recent months, they had yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. In addition, progress towards a durable and self-sustaining convergence of inflation to the Governing Council’s aim remained conditional on a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation.
