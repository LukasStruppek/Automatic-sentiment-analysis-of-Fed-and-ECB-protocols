The recent downward movement in euro area market-based inflation expectations was likely also to reflect diminishing prospects for global reflation. The cost to investors of protecting themselves against inflation in the euro area, which had increased markedly following the outcome of the US presidential election, had peaked in mid-February 2017. Meanwhile, the cost of protection against deflation had remained stable at very low levels. In this respect, the recent decline in inflation expectations was likely to be of a different nature than those observed in earlier episodes, but it nevertheless had contributed to the fall in expected forward inflation rates and, therefore, in medium and long-term nominal yields in recent weeks.
