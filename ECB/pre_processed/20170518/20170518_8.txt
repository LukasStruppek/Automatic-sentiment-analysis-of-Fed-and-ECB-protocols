Volatility in equity markets had spiked both in the United States and in the euro area at the end of March and in early April, and was now back to low levels, suggesting that investors’ risk appetite had improved. Furthermore, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 in the United States had plateaued at record high levels, with the price/earnings ratio reaching its highest level in seven years, equity valuations in the euro area were close to their average for the last five years.
