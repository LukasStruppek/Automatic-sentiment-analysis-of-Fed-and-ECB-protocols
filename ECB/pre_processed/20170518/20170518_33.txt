With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment of the outlook presented by Mr Praet in his introduction. According to Eurostat, annual euro area headline inflation had declined to 1.5% in March 2017, compared with 2.0% in the previous month. It was underlined that this setback followed several months of upward surprises in headline inflation and was mainly related to the volatile components of the HICP, reflecting lower energy and unprocessed food price inflation, although there had also been a fall in services price inflation.
