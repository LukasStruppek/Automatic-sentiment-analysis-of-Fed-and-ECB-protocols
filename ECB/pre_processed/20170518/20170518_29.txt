With regard to domestic risks, it was argued that the reliance of the ECB staff projections on stronger wage growth and a lower household saving ratio pointed to some downside risks to domestic demand looking ahead. It was also considered that there could be a downside risk to activity arising from the weaker than expected recent developments in private sector business investment. However, overall, there was wide agreement that downside risks to activity were diminishing, with the latest data and surveys supporting the assessment that the euro area economic recovery was becoming increasingly solid and suggesting that, at least in the short term, growth in the euro area could turn out to be stronger than previously expected.
