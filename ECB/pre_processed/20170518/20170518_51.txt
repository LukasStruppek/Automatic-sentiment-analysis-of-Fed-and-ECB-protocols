As regards communication, members broadly agreed with the proposals made by Mr Praet in his introduction to keep the communication on the Governing Councilâ€™s monetary policy stance and its forward guidance unchanged, while conveying a more positive tone on the state of the euro area economy and highlighting the increasing solidity of the cyclical recovery and that downside risks had further diminished. Similarly, the Governing Council needed to reiterate its confidence in the effectiveness of its monetary policy measures in supporting growth and inflation.
