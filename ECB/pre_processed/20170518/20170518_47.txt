Hence, from today’s perspective, there was broad agreement among members that the current monetary policy stance remained appropriate. This entailed keeping the ECB’s policy rates unchanged, as well as confirming both the intended pace and horizon of APP purchases and the Governing Council’s forward guidance on policy rates and the asset purchase programme, including the associated “easing biases”. At the same time, the point was made that it could be acknowledged that recourse to these options for providing further accommodation was becoming less likely, in line with the Governing Council’s evolving assessment. In this context, it was also again recalled that the Governing Council’s decision in December 2016 to continue APP purchases as of April 2017 at a reduced monthly pace of €60 billion, as well as to carry out the last targeted longer-term refinancing operation (TLTRO) at the end of March, had already reflected the Governing Council’s more nuanced assessment of overall growing confidence in the economic performance of the euro area economy and vanishing deflation risks.
