The annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3 had remained broadly unchanged in February 2017, at 4.7%, after 4.8% in January, with robust M1 growth as the main driver. The gradual recovery in loan growth had been supported by significant decreases in bank lending rates since summer 2014, as well as by rising demand for bank loans. According to the April 2017 bank lending survey for the euro area, loan growth had been supported by looser lending conditions and increasing demand across all loan categories in the first quarter of 2017. Credit standards had eased for all loan categories in the first quarter of 2017, driven mainly by competitive pressures. At the same time, the ongoing consolidation of financial and non-financial balance sheets and the continued need for adjustment of bank business models in some euro area countries remained a drag on loan growth.
