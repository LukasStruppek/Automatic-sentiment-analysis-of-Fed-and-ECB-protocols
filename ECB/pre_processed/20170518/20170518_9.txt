With regard to the external environment, data that had become available since the 8-9 March Governing Council meeting pointed to a re-synchronised global economic recovery across major regions. The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had risen further to 53.7 in the first quarter of 2017, up from 53.3 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Trade in goods had expanded at the strongest pace in a decade in February 2017. Inflation had continued to pick up gradually in the OECD area, increasing to 2.5% in February from 2.3% in January, while inflation excluding food and energy had remained at 1.9%. Both Brent crude oil prices and non-oil commodity prices had declined overall from their early March levels, while the euro had appreciated by 1.0% in nominal effective terms vis-à-vis the currencies of 38 of the euro area’s major trading partners.
