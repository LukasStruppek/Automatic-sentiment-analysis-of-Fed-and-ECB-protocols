Turning to the euro area, survey information, notably on business and consumer sentiment, confirmed that the economic recovery was becoming increasingly solid, mainly driven by domestic demand on the back of continued improvements in labour markets. Real GDP had increased by 0.5% (revised up by 0.1 percentage point) quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016, after 0.4% in the third quarter. Employment had increased by 0.3% quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the unemployment rate continued to decline, easing to 9.5% in February 2017 after 9.6% in January. As a result, private consumption remained strong, while investment should continue to benefit from very favourable financing conditions. This was also underpinned by higher readings for the composite output and employment PMIs, the European Commissionâ€™s Economic Sentiment Indicator and consumer confidence in the first few months of 2017. The improving external environment was expected to provide additional support to euro area economic activity.
