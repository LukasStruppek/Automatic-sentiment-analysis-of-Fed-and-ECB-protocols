Caution was expressed with respect to interpreting the qualitative balance of replies compiled in the bank lending survey and questions were raised regarding the reported cross-country heterogeneity of the impact of the negative deposit facility rate on bank profits and lending volumes. In this context, it was noted that the pass-through to bank deposit rates had so far been limited and that the ability to adjust margins was seen to depend on the degree of competitive pressures and the size of margins, as well as on institutional features, such as the prevalence of variable rate contracts and indexation, which differed across euro area jurisdictions. It was highlighted that, for the euro area overall, the evidence continued to point to positive effects on lending volumes from the negative rate on the deposit facility, as well as an easing impact on lending rates.
