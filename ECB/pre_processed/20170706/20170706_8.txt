Turning to the foreign exchange market, the euro had appreciated by 3% against the US dollar since the Governing Council’s April monetary policy meeting and by 8% since the start of the year. In nominal effective terms against the currencies of 38 of the euro area’s major trading partners, the euro had appreciated by 2% since the meeting. The appreciation had been accompanied by a reversal of investors’ euro positioning, as shown by data published by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, from the short to the long side in May, and for the first time in many years the sign in net positions had changed. Moreover, in the foreign exchange options market, the volatility priced into put and call option premia had become more balanced compared with end-March and with one year before. Political developments were likely to have also contributed to a strengthening of the euro in effective terms, in particular against the pound sterling, as uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the UK general election on 8 June 2017 had picked up noticeably.
