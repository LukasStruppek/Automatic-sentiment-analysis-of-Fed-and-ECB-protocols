It was also interesting to observe that long-term bond yields in the United States had fallen despite growing market expectations of a reduction in the Federal Reserve balance sheet, which had also been supported by official communication. According to the last Federal Open Market Committee minutes, nearly all policymakers deemed it appropriate to start reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings this year. They had also clarified the likely modus operandi for reducing the balance sheet by announcing “caps” on US Treasuries and agency securities that would be allowed to run off each month. Only the part of the overall bond repayments that exceeded the month’s cap would be reinvested. This, in combination with other factors, implied that the net supply of US Treasuries was widely expected to increase, which, ceteris paribus, should cause long-term yields to rise and not to fall.
