Retail sales to February and new passenger car registrations to March pointed to a pick-up in private consumption growth in the first quarter of 2016. While retail sales in January and February stood, on average, 0.8% above their average for the fourth quarter of 2015, new passenger car registrations rose, quarter on quarter, by 3.0% in the first quarter of 2016. At the same time, survey data for consumption had been on a declining trend since the second half of 2015, with a number of factors, such as the more recent rebound in oil prices, the refugee influx and the recent terrorist attacks, at work.
