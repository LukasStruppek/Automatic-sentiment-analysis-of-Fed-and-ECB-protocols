CSPP purchases would be conducted both in the secondary market and in the primary market, except purchases of debt securities of public undertakings for which, by virtue of the provisions of Article 123 of the Treaty, primary market purchases were not allowed. Purchases of bonds issued by public companies would be subject to additional safeguards, in addition to the prohibition of primary market purchases, in a manner consistent with the practice followed under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP). The eligible counterparties would be those eligible for Eurosystem monetary policy operations and any other counterparty used by the Eurosystem for the investment of its euro-denominated portfolio, which was the rule applied for the other programmes under the APP.
