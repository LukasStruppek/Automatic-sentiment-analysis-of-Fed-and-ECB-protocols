On the main features governing the operational framework of the CSPP, it was underlined that the programme had a euro area-wide focus and was subject to full income and loss sharing. Turning to the parameters governing the geographical and sectoral scope of the CSPP, it was also argued that the effectiveness of the CSPP should not be gauged by the size of purchases per se but depended on the targeted transmission channels aimed at supporting credit to the real economy. It was stressed that the inclusion of resident corporate issuers with non-euro area parent companies would often allow companies with significant real economy presence and investment in the euro area to benefit from the programme, while the CSPP would in any case be transmitted across corporate bond markets, including non-resident issuers, via portfolio balance effects.
