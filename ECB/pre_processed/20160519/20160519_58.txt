With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by MrÂ Praet in his introduction. Broad money (M3) had continued to grow at a robust pace. Some encouraging signals were seen to come from recent data on credit growth and the evidence from the euro area bank lending survey. The bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2016 indicated further improvements in loan supply conditions for enterprises and in loan demand across all loan categories. Overall, the monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 had clearly improved borrowing conditions for firms and households, as well as credit flows across the euro area.
