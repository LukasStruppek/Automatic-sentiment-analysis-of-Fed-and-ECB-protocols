The euro area net lending position, as a percentage of nominal GDP, had continued to increase over the last year and a half, despite the strong recovery in domestic demand. This had also been reflected in the increase in the euro area current account surplus since mid-2014, which could be mainly explained by the drop in oil prices. The increased contribution of non-financial corporations (NFCs) to the euro area total net lending position – which had reached a historical high – indicated that firms had been retaining windfall gains from lower energy prices, rather than investing them or distributing them to shareholders.
