Generally, it was agreed that giving structural reform recommendations might prove challenging, as structural reform needs differed widely across euro area countries and it was not necessarily possible to generalise at the euro area aggregate level. Moreover, it was recalled that there were already country-specific recommendations in the context of the European Semester. Thus, a procedure already existed whereby the European Commission was responsible for supporting the coordination of economic policies in the euro area and, more broadly, in the European Union. It was to be regretted that these very detailed, country-specific recommendations were not being sufficiently followed up and implemented. That said, it also had to be acknowledged that there had been some progress in implementing structural reforms in the euro area. Many countries had implemented labour market reforms, although product market reforms did not seem to have kept pace. More product market reforms could be considered the highest priority at the current juncture.
