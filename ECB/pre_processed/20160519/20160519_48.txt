Members also discussed recent developments in inflation expectations. It was noted that the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead currently stood at around 1.4% and that the latest round of the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters indicated that average longer-term inflation expectations remained at 1.8%, unchanged from the previous round. It was considered worrisome that, despite the stabilisation in oil prices, market-based inflation expectations had not picked up from their low levels. It appeared that there had been some decoupling of inflation expectations from oil price developments following the earlier correlation during the period when oil prices had fallen. While, in principle, a decoupling of inflation expectations from oil price developments was welcome, in the current context this was a matter of concern, as longer-term inflation expectations were not recovering in parallel with higher oil prices. At the same time, it was noted that expectations of future oil price increases and their contribution to HICP inflation could have fallen below past averages, which might in part explain the continued low level of market-based inflation expectations. In that regard, structural changes in the supply of oil, such as increased shale oil and gas production and Iranâ€™s return to the market, could imply that low oil prices would, in the future, be a more persistent feature of inflation dynamics. On the other hand, geopolitical risks might have an impact on raw material and commodity prices, alongside other factors determining headline inflation in the next year or so.
