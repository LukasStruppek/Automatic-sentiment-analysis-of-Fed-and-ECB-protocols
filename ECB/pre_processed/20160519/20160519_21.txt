Turning to price developments in the euro area, annual HICP inflation had increased from -0.2% in February 2016 to 0.0% in March, with the March figure having been revised upwards by 0.1 percentage point compared with the flash estimate. This increase in HICP inflation had been driven by an increase in the rates of the services and unprocessed food components. Over the same period, underlying inflation, as measured by the HICP excluding food and energy, had risen from 0.8% to 1.0%. Also taking into account seasonal factors, neither the annual rate of the HICP excluding food and energy – which had been hovering around 1.0% since summer 2015 – nor other measures of underlying inflation, showed clear signs as yet of a more dynamic upward development.
