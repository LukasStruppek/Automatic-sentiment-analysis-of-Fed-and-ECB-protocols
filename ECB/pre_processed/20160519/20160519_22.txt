Pipeline and import price pressures showed signs of renewed easing. Annual producer price inflation for domestic sales of non-food consumer goods, which had been unchanged at 0.2% from August to December 2015, had declined to 0.1% in January 2016 and further to -0.1% in February. Survey data for input and output prices to April also pointed to a continuation of subdued domestic price pressures at the producer level, particularly for the earlier stages of the production and pricing chain. At the same time, import price inflation for non-food consumer goods, which had so far been the main source of upward pipeline pressures, had decreased to 0.7% in February, down from 1.7% in January.
