Finally, turning to fiscal policies, members highlighted the need to remain in compliance with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact in order to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework, while at the same time supporting the economic recovery. It was recalled that countries should strive for a more growth‑friendly composition of fiscal policies, including the reduction of the tax burden on households and firms, and should lower current government expenditure and increase the share of public investment within overall government expenditure. Moreover, fiscal space should be used where appropriate. It was suggested that more use should be made of incentives to stimulate investment and of programmes at the EU level. While it would be desirable to see results from the European Commission’s investment plan come to fruition quickly, the comment was also made that the plan might not go far enough.
