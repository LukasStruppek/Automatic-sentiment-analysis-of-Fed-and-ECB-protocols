With respect to eligible residual maturities, some remarks were made that the proposed upper limit of above 30 years seemed to be on the long side. However, overall, a preference for retaining long maturities was nonetheless expressed to avoid a weakening of the transmission impact, given the longer average duration of the bonds that would be excluded. Moreover, the potential for increased issuance at longer durations should also be taken into account. With respect to other risk control parameters for the CSPP, after an exchange of views on the relative merits of different limits, an overall preference for retaining the proposed issue share limit of 70% was expressed, consistent with the other private sector purchase programmes under the APP and the broad scope of the programme.
