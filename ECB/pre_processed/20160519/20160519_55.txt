Overall, while it was considered useful for the ECB to discuss matters further and to focus on the adverse consequences for the euro area of a lack of reforms, establishing a detailed country-specific agenda was in the realm of national governments and other European institutions. When discussing structural reforms, the Governing Council would take a clear monetary policy perspective, assessing the impact of pending structural reforms and the environment in which the ECB conducted monetary policy. First and foremost, this entailed an assessment of the extent to which structural reforms affected developments in inflation, most notably with respect to their short and long-run effects, including possibly persistent disinflationary effects arising from too slow an implementation of structural reforms. Moreover, an assessment was needed of how, and to what extent, structural reforms would support convergence among euro area countries and improve risk-sharing for markets.
