With respect to the time horizon needed for HICP inflation rates to return to levels below, but close to, 2%, it was recalled that the ECB’s monetary policy strategy, for good reasons, had not specified a precise definition of the medium term, as the policy horizon depended on the nature of the shocks affecting the economy and the length of the de facto variable transmission lags of monetary policy. In particular, the medium-term horizon should not be equated to the horizon of the staff projections, as outside observers sometimes appeared to do when characterising the Governing Council’s reaction function. In this regard, great care was needed when framing the Governing Council’s reaction function, also in the context of forward guidance, to avoid conveying the sense that monetary policy was mechanically focused on a specific time horizon.
