With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction. Based on incoming information, the ongoing moderate recovery could be expected to proceed, with domestic demand, in particular, continuing to be supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures. At the same time, the risks to the euro area growth outlook still remained tilted to the downside. Inflation dynamics remained weak and annual HICP inflation could turn negative again in the coming months, before picking up in the second half of 2016 and recovering further in 2017 and 2018, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery.
