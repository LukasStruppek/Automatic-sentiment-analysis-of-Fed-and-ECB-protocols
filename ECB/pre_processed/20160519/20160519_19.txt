The non-financial quarterly sector accounts data indicated that euro area profits were on a recovery path. The ratio of net operating surplus to value added had increased further in the fourth quarter of 2015. NFCs’ retained earnings to value added had also significantly increased. The year-on-year growth of nominal NFCs’ gross fixed capital formation had accelerated to 5.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015, from 3.8% in the third quarter. Looking at overall investment, the recovery had been mainly driven by the non-construction sector, with rising capacity utilisation among the supportive factors. Looking ahead, non-construction investment should further benefit from the positive domestic demand dynamics, the continued accommodative monetary policy stance and improving financing conditions, while continued deleveraging needs, still low profit levels and institutional rigidities were expected to weigh negatively.
