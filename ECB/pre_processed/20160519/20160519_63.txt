The focus should now be on the implementation of the latest set of decisions, including the new series of TLTROs and the CSPP, which were geared towards enhancing monetary transmission by supporting credit creation and further strengthening the pass-through of the Eurosystem’s asset purchases to financing conditions in the real economy. It needed to be recalled that it was not just the announcement effects that had an impact, but also the implementation phase, which had not yet begun in the case of these latest measures. Hence, further monetary policy stimulus was still in the pipeline, notably from the CSPP and TLTRO II, which were set to start in June 2016.
