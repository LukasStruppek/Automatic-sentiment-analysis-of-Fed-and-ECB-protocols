The domestic nature of the ongoing recovery was also reflected in further improving labour markets. Employment in the euro area had risen by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a result, employment stood 1.2% higher than a year ago â€“ the highest annual increase since the second quarter of 2008. The unemployment rate, which had been declining since mid-2013, had stood at 10.3% in February 2016. Despite these improvements, labour market rigidities persisted and unemployment remained very high from a historical perspective.
