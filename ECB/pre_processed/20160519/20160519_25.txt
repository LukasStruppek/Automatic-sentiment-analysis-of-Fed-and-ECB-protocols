Looking at recent developments in long-term inflation expectations, market-based measures had broadly stabilised at low levels over the past few weeks, after some recovery in early March, while survey-based measures had been more stable. The April Survey of Professional Forecasters showed the average point forecast for inflation five years ahead at 1.8%, broadly unchanged from the previous round. All in all, financial market participants appeared to show little uncertainty that medium-term inflation would stay low, while deflation fears remained contained and visibly below the early-2015 peak.
