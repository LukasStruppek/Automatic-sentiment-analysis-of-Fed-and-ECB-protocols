The March staff projections for euro area HICP inflation in 2016 were lower than forecasts by private and international institutions. For 2017, the staff projections also remained at the lower end of the range, although the differences were more limited. For 2018, the ECB projections broadly stood in the middle of the range, although some institutional forecasters had yet to publish their forecasts at this horizon. The April Survey of Professional Forecasters, covering the second quarter of 2016, showed average inflation expectations of 0.3%, 1.3% and 1.6% for 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively.
