A benchmark for guiding purchases would be defined at the issuer group level. It would be neutral in the sense that it would reflect proportionally all outstanding issues qualifying for the benchmark. This also implied that market capitalisation would provide a weighting for each of the jurisdictions of issuance within the benchmark. Issuer group limits would be based on the benchmark to ensure a diverse portfolio, while at the same time they would offer sufficient leeway to build up the portfolio.
