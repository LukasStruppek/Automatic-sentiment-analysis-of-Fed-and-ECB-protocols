Annual growth in householdsâ€™ real disposable income had decelerated slightly to 1.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with 1.6% in the third quarter. Over the same period, consumption growth had slowed from 1.8% to 1.5%, partly due to temporary factors, while the savings rate had remained broadly unchanged. As regards investment, the stronger dynamics of the fourth quarter of 2015 had been driven by both construction and non-construction investment, with construction having benefited from the mild winter.
