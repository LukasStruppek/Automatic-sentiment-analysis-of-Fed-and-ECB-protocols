Turning to the euro area, members concurred with the view that the economic recovery was ongoing. Growth dynamics were seen to be supported by the monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financing conditions, improvements in employment growth and the still relatively low price of oil, which supported consumption. Moreover, it was observed that, if growth for the first quarter of this year were to materialise in line with expectations, this would constitute the twelfth consecutive quarter of positive economic growth for the euro area and the seventh quarter in a row of growth above potential. As a consequence, the output gap was closing, albeit only very gradually. Such a slow speed of adjustment was not unusual in the context of a balance sheet recession, which implied some “leakage” in the virtuous circle that normally took place between income and consumption growth. At the same time, it was pointed out that the updated IMF forecasts for growth in the euro area had been revised downwards, notwithstanding the inclusion of the latest monetary policy package announced in March 2016. In addition, some concern was expressed that the EuroCOIN indicator, which was often cited as a useful cyclical indicator of growth in the euro area, had in March seen its sharpest fall in over three years.
