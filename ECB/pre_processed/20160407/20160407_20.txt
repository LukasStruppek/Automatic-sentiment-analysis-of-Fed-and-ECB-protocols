Regarding financial and monetary conditions, the euro area yield curve had flattened substantially and was currently much lower than at the time of the December 2015 monetary policy meeting. In addition, following the sharp tightening in financial conditions after that meeting, on the back of the euro appreciation and the decline in equities, some reversal had taken place since the second half of February. Moreover, both the equity risk premium and non-financial corporate bond spreads had shown an increasing trend since spring and summer 2015 respectively. This differed from developments in the market for risk-free assets, where sovereign debt had become scarcer, as reflected by the decline in the risk-free rate. Since equity financing dominated the balance sheet of NFCs, the weighted average nominal cost of NFCsâ€™ external financing had not declined more sharply even though the cost of bank borrowing had been falling substantially since mid-2014. In January 2016 the composite MFI lending rates for NFCs and households had remained broadly stable at low levels.
