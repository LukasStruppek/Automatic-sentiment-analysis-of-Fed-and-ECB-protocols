Regarding the outlook and risks for the external environment, the latest staff projections contained further downward revisions in the short term to global activity and trade. It was remarked that the downward revisions could to some extent be considered as the materialisation of risks which had already been identified by the Governing Council in September 2015. In this context, it was highlighted that the baseline projection for the euro area was predicated on the assumption of a rather swift rebound in world trade. While the baseline was generally supported, caution was also expressed about the projected strengthening in global activity. Overall, despite some better economic news emanating recently from the United States, there was broad agreement that the outlook for the external environment continued to be uncertain and subject to downside risks, largely related to vulnerabilities in emerging market economies.
