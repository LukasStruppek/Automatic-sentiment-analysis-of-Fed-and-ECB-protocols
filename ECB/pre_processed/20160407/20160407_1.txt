Mr Cœuré reviewed financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 20-21 January 2016. The global economic outlook had deteriorated further, accompanied by bouts of market volatility, particularly in markets for bank liabilities. Oil prices had rebounded in February after having fallen to their lowest level since 2003. The outlook for oil prices remained uncertain, however, as the oil market was still experiencing over-supply and global oil inventories remained at very high levels. The potential for a lasting rebound in the oil market was unclear, according to market participants. Market-based indicators of inflation expectations had continued to broadly follow the price of petrol, but not the recent rebound in the price of crude oil, and the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had reached a historical low of 1.36% on 29 February.
