Turning to the euro area, real GDP had continued to grow in the fourth quarter of 2015, increasing by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, with domestic demand being the main driver. Incoming data since 21 January had been mixed overall. While euro area industrial production (excluding construction) had declined by 1%, month on month, in December, the volume of retail sales, taken together with new passenger car registrations, had risen in January to 1.3% above the average level recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. At the same time, both the Economic Sentiment Indicator and the composite output PMI had declined in January and February to levels below their fourth-quarter averages, but still above their long-term averages.
