Broad support was expressed for the proposal to include investment-grade euro-denominated bonds issued by non-bank corporations as a new asset class in the eligible universe of purchasable assets under the APP. The inclusion of corporate bonds was seen as strengthening the credibility of the overall expansion of the monthly purchase volume and more directly signalling the support provided by the APP for the financing of the real economy. It was also noted that the purchases could have important spillover effects on the financing conditions of SMEs in the light of international evidence indicating that the banking sector redirected lending to SMEs when large companiesâ€™ bond issuance substituted for bank borrowing.
