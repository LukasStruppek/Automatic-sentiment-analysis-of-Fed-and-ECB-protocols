Annual growth in households’ real disposable income had decelerated to 1.7% in the third quarter of 2015, compared with 2.2% in the second quarter. At the same time, consumption growth had slowed to 1.5% in the fourth quarter, from 1.8% in the third quarter, while the savings rate had remained broadly unchanged. As regards investment, the stronger dynamics recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 appeared to have been partly driven by construction investment, which had benefited from the mild winter. The PMI for construction had risen in January 2016 into positive growth territory for the first time since 2008, and the European Commission’s construction confidence index had improved in February.
