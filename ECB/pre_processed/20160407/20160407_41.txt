Commenting on the outlook for domestic demand in more detail, the balance of risks was mostly seen to be on the downside. While noting that wage dynamics were expected to be weaker than previously foreseen, members expressed the view that the outlook for income growth, as foreseen in the staff projections, might still be subject to downside risks given the past projection errors in wages, the degree of slack remaining in the labour market and the possible effects of past structural reforms. It was noted that labour market conditions in the euro area, although improving, were still far from those in other major economies, such as the United States and the United Kingdom.
