With regard to price developments in the euro area, there was broad agreement with the assessment of the outlook and risks presented by Mr Praet in his introduction. The return to negative headline inflation in February was due to lower annual rates in all the main components, including services and non-energy industrial goods. According to Eurostatâ€™s flash release, the annual rate of HICP inflation excluding food and energy had also fallen back unexpectedly. In the short term, on the basis of current oil futures prices, headline inflation was expected to remain in negative territory for a number of months, before rising later in the year, linked to strong upward base effects and the assumed oil price increases embedded in the futures curve. Over the medium term, inflation was expected to pick up in line with the economic recovery in the baseline projection.
