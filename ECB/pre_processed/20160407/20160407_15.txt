Euro area labour markets had continued to gradually improve. Employment had risen by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2015. As a result, employment had been 1.1% higher than a year ago – the highest annual increase since the second quarter of 2008. The unemployment rate, which had been declining since mid-2013, had stood at 10.3% in January 2016 – the lowest rate since August 2011. Despite these improvements, labour market rigidities persisted and unemployment remained very high from a historical perspective.
