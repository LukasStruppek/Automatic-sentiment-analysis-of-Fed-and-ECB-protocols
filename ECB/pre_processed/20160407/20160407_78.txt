It needed to be emphasised that the monetary policy measures taken had proven to be effective and had delivered significant effects on growth in inflation. In a counterfactual scenario of the absence of monetary policy support, inflation would likely be significantly in negative territory and economic growth would be visibly lower. The current low inflation environment should not be attributed to ineffective monetary policy measures, rather it was largely the result of a succession of negative shocks stemming mainly from the external environment, but also from weaker than expected domestic price pressures. At the same time, it was highlighted that the possible risks and side effects of the monetary policy instruments in use, particularly with regard to financial stability risks, had to be better understood and required further careful analysis and assessment.
