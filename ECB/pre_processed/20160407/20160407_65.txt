A few members restated their reservations concerning the APP, namely with respect to public sector bonds, and voiced concerns as on previous occasions about a further expansion of asset purchases, as purchases of sovereign securities were, more than other monetary policy instruments, associated with a number of specific challenges and side effects. The view was reiterated that recourse to broad-based asset purchases, including public sector paper, should therefore remain a contingency instrument, to be used only as an ultima ratio in an adverse scenario, such as a situation of imminent deflation, for which there was no evidence at present. In this regard, the costs and risks of engaging further in public sector asset purchases, particularly in the medium to long term, would outweigh their potential benefits, also considering diminishing returns of scale and taking into account that even deeper cuts in the deposit facility rate or strongly targeted lending operations could have more traction on the economy.
