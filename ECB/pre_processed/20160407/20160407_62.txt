Regarding the applicable interest rate over the life of TLTRO II, members generally felt that it was appropriate to charge a fixed rate upon allotment of the operation. This would be simple and attractive, as banks could lock in their TLTRO funds at very favourable funding conditions for four years. With respect to the definition of eligible loans, on the basis of which the borrowing allowance would be calculated, it was agreed that the practice applied in the first series of TLTROs should be maintained, whereby eligible loans were defined as those of euro area NFCs and households, excluding loans to households for house purchase. The assessment was widely shared that lending for house purchase was best excluded from the TLTROs to avoid fuelling housing price bubbles by channelling savings into the housing sector.
