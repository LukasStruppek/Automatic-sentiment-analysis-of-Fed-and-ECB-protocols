Against this background, members reiterated the necessity for other policy areas to support sustained output growth and that monetary policy on its own was not sufficient. There was a need for both structural reforms and fiscal policy to also play their part. In particular, given the high level of structural unemployment in the euro area and the low growth in potential output, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies regarding both labour and product markets. In addition to leading to higher sustainable economic growth, structural reforms would help to improve the resilience of the euro area to global shocks. As regards fiscal policy, members highlighted the need to comply with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, while at the same time stressing that existing elements of flexibility should be used. A more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies could support the economic recovery, as could the use of fiscal space, where appropriate.
