All in all, Mr Praet concluded that since the start of credit easing policies in June 2014 and their reinforcement through public sector asset purchases half a year later, the ECBâ€™s monetary policy measures had led to a substantial easing of financial conditions and improved access to finance in the euro area, thereby providing sizeable support to inflation and economic activity. The improvements not only pertained to overall financial conditions in the euro area, but also to reduced fragmentation. The dispersion of lending rates to borrowers domiciled in different jurisdictions had narrowed, remuneration of bank deposits had become much less diverse and, in most countries, NFCs were benefiting from more favourable conditions on loans. Furthermore, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) currently faced fewer obstacles to access financing. Nevertheless, the prospects for a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation had deteriorated once more, owing to worsening external conditions, despite the adoption of additional monetary policy measures in December 2015.
