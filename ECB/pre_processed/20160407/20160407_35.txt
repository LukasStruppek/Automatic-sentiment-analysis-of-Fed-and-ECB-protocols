Regarding the incentive scheme, banks exceeding the benchmark would be rewarded with lower borrowing rates that could be as low as the rate on the deposit facility. More specifically, the interest rate for counterparties below the benchmark would be fixed at the MRO rate prevailing at the date of the allotment. Banks exceeding their benchmark would be retroactively charged at a lower rate for the entire term of the operation and that rate would also be linked to the interest rate on the deposit facility at the date of allotment.
