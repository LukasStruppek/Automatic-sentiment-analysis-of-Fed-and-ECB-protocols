Against this background, overall, members broadly supported a further cut in the deposit facility rate. With respect to the envisaged size of such a cut, the importance of communication and the link to the formulation of forward guidance was underlined. On the one hand, a sharper rate cut could be considered, together with indications that the effective lower bound would have been reached for all practical purposes. On the other hand, the proposed limited rate cut could be judged as appropriate for now, given the current assessment, while it would also not rule out the possibility and prospect of further cuts if warranted by the outlook for price stability.
