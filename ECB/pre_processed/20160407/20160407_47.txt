Members expressed concern about the prospect that it would now take longer to reach the inflation objective than previously expected. According to the latest ECB staff projections, which now incorporated projections for 2018 for the first time, headline inflation was expected to be only 1.6% in 2018, underpinning the assessment that the return of headline inflation to rates below, but close to, 2% would be further postponed. The sequence of downward revisions over time to both the growth and inflation projections was recalled. Against this background, it was felt that it had to be acknowledged that inflation would not return to the ECB’s inflation aim for some time to come, while keeping in mind that the ECB’s definition of price stability over the medium term was not tied to the horizon of the staff projections. In this context, attention was drawn to the fact that inflation had already been well below 2% for most of the period since 2012. The adverse implications of persistently low inflation for the process of debt deleveraging and also for financial stability were pointed out, by comparing this profile for inflation with a counterfactual one in which inflation was close to 2% over the same period.
