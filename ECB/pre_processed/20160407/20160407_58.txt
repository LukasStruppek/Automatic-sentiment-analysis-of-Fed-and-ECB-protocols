There was thus broad agreement among members that a strong policy response was required, which was best achieved by a comprehensive package of measures that exploited the synergies and complementarities between its different components. This package needed to be adequately calibrated to further ease financing conditions, stimulate new credit provision and thereby reinforce the momentum of the euro areaâ€™s economic recovery and accelerate the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2%. While, overall, members widely agreed on the need for comprehensive policy action, different views were expressed with regard to the individual components of the proposed package.
