Members exchanged views about the implications of the latest developments in measures of underlying inflation. In particular, concern was expressed about the lower rate of HICP inflation excluding food and energy in the February flash release. It was noted that, if the reasons for the decline were permanent, this would dampen the outlook for underlying inflation still further. However, the reasons behind the decline in HICP inflation excluding food and energy in the latest release had not yet been fully explored, and it was possible that a significant part of this decline was due to temporary factors.
