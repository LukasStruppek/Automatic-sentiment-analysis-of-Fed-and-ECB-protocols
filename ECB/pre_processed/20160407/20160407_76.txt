In the overall assessment of the proposed policy package, some remarks were made on the effectiveness of the monetary policy measures taken previously and of the proposed policy package, also in view of recent market concerns about the limits of monetary policy. Members broadly agreed that the monetary policy measures taken since June 2014 had been critical in supporting the euro area recovery and in arresting even stronger disinflation. It was therefore seen as important to firmly reiterate that the monetary policy measures were working and had been delivering their intended effects, for which there was ample evidence. The combination of measures, such as the rate cuts, the forward guidance, the earlier credit easing measures and the APP, had led to a broad-based and significant easing in financing conditions for all sectors of the economy.
