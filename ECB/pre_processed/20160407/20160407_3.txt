In the United States, market expectations for the next rate hike had been pushed back significantly, with a sharp re-pricing between January and February, followed by some correction in the light of recent better than expected indicators, in particular inflation. A 25 basis point rate hike in the United States was not fully priced in until December 2016, which was well beyond what had been expected at the beginning of the year. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, money market forward rates had shifted considerably lower, with the Sterling Overnight Index Average forward curve becoming inverted, fully pricing in a 10 basis point rate cut by the end of 2016. This was in stark contrast to what had been expected at the beginning of 2016.
