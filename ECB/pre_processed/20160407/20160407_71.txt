On the other hand, a number of arguments were put forward pointing to the benefits of a further cut in the deposit facility rate. Lowering the rate further into negative territory was seen as an effective tool for providing additional monetary easing, which also reinforced the impact of the other monetary policy measures in place by stimulating the “velocity of reserves”. Moreover, past cuts in the rate had not only led to lower short-term interest rates, but had compressed interest rates across the spectrum of the yield curve also at the longer end. As regards the possible impact on banks’ profitability, a general equilibrium perspective was warranted that went beyond the direct effects of negative interest rates on the profit and loss account of banks. Taking a broader view, on balance, the combination of all monetary policy measures taken, including negative rates, appeared to have contributed positively to banks’ profitability thus far. This was evidenced by overall increasing net interest income and banks’ return on equity in the course of 2015, the first full year of negative rates, as well as by rising lending volumes. Banks appeared to benefit from the low interest rate environment, as a decline in interest revenues was more than compensated for by lower costs of funding and an expansion in credit volumes, together with possible holding gains on assets. With regard to the possible external dimension of a policy rate cut, it had to be stressed that further monetary easing was aimed at improving domestic financing conditions.
