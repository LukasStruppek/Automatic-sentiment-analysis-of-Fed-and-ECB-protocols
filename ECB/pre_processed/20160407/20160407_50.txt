At the same time, it was mentioned that, although underlying inflation remained positive, the decline recorded in February was a new element, which raised questions about the outlook for inflation compared with the situation last year, when core inflation had been rising slowly, but steadily, by around 0.1 percentage point each quarter. On the one hand, the weakness in HICP inflation excluding food and energy could be read as a signal of the insufficient level of aggregate demand in the economy, which, it was argued, remained the main problem for the euro area. On the other hand, it was reasoned that there had also been deeper changes in the saving and spending behaviour of economic agents after the financial crisis, reflecting, among other things, rebalancing needs, including wage and price adjustments, and balance sheet repair in a number of sectors and countries. As a consequence of such, possibly structural, changes, past experience did not provide much guidance as regards the reaction of inflation to the closing of the output gap, which gave rise to increased uncertainty about the inflation outlook.
