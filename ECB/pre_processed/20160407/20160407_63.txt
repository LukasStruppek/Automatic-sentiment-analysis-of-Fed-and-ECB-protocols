On the calculation of the benchmark, there was broad support for maintaining the mechanism adopted for the first series of TLTROs. Accordingly, the benchmark net lending would be set at zero for those banks with positive net lending, while the benchmark would be set at a lower level for those banks that were undergoing deleveraging. For banks to fully reap the benefits of the attractive new conditions of TLTRO II, it was also agreed they should be given an extra repayment opportunity for the existing TLTROs, to allow them to switch to the more attractive conditions of TLTRO II.
