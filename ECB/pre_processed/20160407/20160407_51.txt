Recent developments in euro area inflation expectations were also scrutinised by members. The further decline in market-based measures since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, and the risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations, continued to be a key concern. The importance of halting the decline in inflation expectations was emphasised. Wage increases had already turned out much lower than previously expected, albeit for a range of different reasons, including windfall gains in households’ real disposable income, and concern was voiced that second-round effects might be larger than those incorporated into the staff projections. It was important to avoid a pattern of low wages and low prices becoming entrenched in the expectations and behaviour of economic agents. At the same time, some caution was again expressed regarding the reliability of the information content of market-based measures of inflation expectations, for a number of reasons, including liquidity effects associated with the ECB’s APP. It was also noted that survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, such as the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, remained more benign. According to this view, while there was a danger that persistently low inflation outcomes might spill over into inflation expectations, the risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations and of deflation could still be considered to be low.
