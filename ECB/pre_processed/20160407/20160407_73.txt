Most members favoured the proposed cut of 10 basis points, in conjunction with maintaining the formulation of “at present or lower levels” in the Governing Council’s forward guidance. It was argued that, from today’s perspective, and taking into account the support provided by the policy measures to growth and inflation, policy rates would be expected to remain at very low levels and that further rate reductions would not be anticipated at this stage. Nonetheless, the Governing Council would not rule out future cuts in policy rates, as new shocks could change the outlook for inflation, which might warrant further monetary policy action, with policy rates remaining part of the Governing Council’s toolbox.
