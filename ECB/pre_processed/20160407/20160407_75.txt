Finally, as regards forward guidance, broad support was expressed for linking the forward guidance on the likely future path of policy interest rates to the forward guidance on the asset purchases in a hierarchical and sequential manner by adding “and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases” to the existing formulation on forward guidance. This would anchor expectations about the relative sequencing, thereby providing greater clarity about the Governing Council’s expectations with respect to the future path of policy interest rates. The envisaged formulation on policy rate forward guidance needed to be fully consistent with the ECB’s monetary policy strategy, to reflect the current forward guidance on asset purchases and to ensure interdependence of the APP and the policy interest rates. However, a remark was also made that keeping interest rates low well past the horizon of the APP could be perceived by the public as allowing inflation to overshoot in the future.
