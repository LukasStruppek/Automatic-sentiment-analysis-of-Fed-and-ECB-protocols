From a global perspective, economies could be considered to be at different stages of the financial cycle, with the United States being more advanced than the euro area and perhaps having even completed the associated process of balance sheet correction, while in the euro area this was still under way. It was also noted that there could potentially be more positive news for the credit outlook from the regulatory side, with indications of a forthcoming clarification by the European Commission on the nature of Pillar 2 requirements under the Capital Requirements Directive, which could be reflected in the implementation of these requirements by the Single Supervisory Mechanism and could help reduce some of the regulatory uncertainty weighing on euro area banks.
