On the one hand, concerns were raised about possible undesirable side effects that could arise from moving further into negative territory, particularly in combination with fast-growing excess liquidity. A further cut in the deposit facility rate could unduly increase the pressure on banks’ profitability, which could have adverse effects on the stability of the banking sector. As rates on bank customers’ deposits were typically constrained at zero, a further decline in rates charged on the asset side would lead to a compression in banks’ margins. Moreover, the transmission of monetary policy via bank intermediation could be affected negatively, as banks could recoup part of the costs by increasing lending rates or increasing fees and other charges in their cross-selling activities. Cutting interest rates further, in a market environment where uncertainty about the impact of negative rates prevailed, could also further exacerbate financial market volatility and have direct, negative repercussions on the confidence of euro area households and firms, as well as weigh on the profitability of insurance companies and pension funds, including corporate pension schemes. Finally, caution was also expressed with regard to the effectiveness of further reductions in the deposit facility rate, both as regards domestic channels of transmission and the exchange rate channel.
