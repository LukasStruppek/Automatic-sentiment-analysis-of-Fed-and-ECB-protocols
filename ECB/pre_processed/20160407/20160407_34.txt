With regard to the four TLTRO II operations to be launched at a quarterly frequency from June 2016 to March 2017, each operation would have a four-year maturity from the respective settlement date. Voluntary repayments would be possible two years after the settlement of each operation, at a quarterly frequency, and, in contrast to the first series of TLTROs, no mandatory early repayment was envisaged. Counterparties would participate individually or as part of a group in the same way as for the current TLTROs and with the same group definition, meaning that groups could be unchanged from the first series of TLTROs to the second. New groups could also be created for TLTRO II. Each participant could borrow an amount equivalent to 30% of its stock of eligible loans as at 31 January 2016, less any amount previously borrowed and still outstanding under the first two TLTRO operations conducted in 2014. The definition of eligible loans would be the same as for the first series of TLTROs. The applicable benchmark would be based on net lending in the 12-month period between 31 January 2015 and 31 January 2016.
