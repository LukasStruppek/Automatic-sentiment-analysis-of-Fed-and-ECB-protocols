The March 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresaw annual real GDP increasing by 1.4% in 2016, 1.7% in 2017 and 1.8% in 2018. Compared with the December 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth had been revised downwards, by 0.4 percentage point in 2016 and by 0.1 percentage point in 2017, mainly reflecting the weakened growth prospects for the global economy.
