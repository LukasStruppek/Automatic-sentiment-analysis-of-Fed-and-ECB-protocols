Very broad support was expressed for the view that TLTRO II would need to be equipped with strong price incentives to encourage new lending to the real economy. Attractive funding conditions for banks, in turn, were seen to further ease private sector credit conditions and to stimulate overall credit dynamics. Therefore, the proposed inbuilt price incentive scheme of TLTRO II, aimed at providing incentives for the creation of new credit to the private sector, was widely supported. It was argued that the pricing scheme of TLTRO II would also contribute to a further defragmentation in the money markets. While, in the current circumstances, some banks could already borrow at the EONIA rate, the TLTROs would ease funding conditions for a broader range of banks, provided they were able to increase lending to the real economy in excess of the respective benchmarks.
