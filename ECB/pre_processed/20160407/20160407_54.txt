Loan dynamics had continued on the gradual recovery path observed since the beginning of 2014. Bank credit to both firms and households had continued to expand, with the annual rate of change of loans to NFCs (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) rebounding in January. Developments in MFI loans to enterprises continued to mirror the lagged relationship with the business cycle and credit risk, as well as ongoing balance sheet adjustments, which reflected still high levels of non-performing loans. Loan dynamics were also supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the pass-through of monetary policy measures in place since June 2014, which had improved borrowing conditions and credit flows across the euro area. Notably, fragmentation across euro area countries had declined, with a significant compression of loan spreads. The ECBâ€™s monetary policy measures were thus seen to have contributed strongly to the turn in the credit cycle in the euro area since 2014.
