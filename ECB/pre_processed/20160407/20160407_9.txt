Since the Governing Councilâ€™s previous monetary policy meeting on 20-21 January 2016, the EONIA forward curve had shifted downwards by between 7 and 10 basis points and had reached levels below those prevailing before the December 2015 meeting. The market was firmly pricing in at least a 10 basis point cut in the rate on the deposit facility at the current meeting. In addition, the one-year forward EONIA swap rate one year ahead had declined to a new all-time low, at -53 basis points (on 3 March), and the entire EURIBOR cash curve was now in negative territory for the first time ever.
