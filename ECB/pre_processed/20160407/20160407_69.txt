Turning to interest rates, broad support was expressed for the proposal to lower all the key ECB policy interest rates further, whereby the rate on the MROs and the rate on the marginal lending facility would be cut by 5 basis points to 0.00% and 0.25% respectively, and the rate on the deposit facility would be cut by 10 basis points to -0.40%. Nonetheless, different views were expressed about the costs and benefits of moving further into negative territory and the respective implications for the formulation of the Governing Councilâ€™s forward guidance on policy interest rates.
