Private consumption was expected to remain robust, based on continued real income growth, supported by low energy prices and a further gradual improvement in euro area labour markets, and business investment was expected to pick up, in line with increasing demand. A number of positive indicators were also mentioned, which could provide a basis for more optimism about the current economic situation, including the January industrial production data for the two largest euro area countries and the continued improvement in labour markets, which reflected some positive effects of past structural reforms. The view was put forward that, taking these factors into account, the outlook for the euro area should not be regarded as overly pessimistic and conveying an unduly gloomy assessment should be avoided.
