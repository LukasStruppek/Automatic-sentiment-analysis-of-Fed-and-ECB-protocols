According to Eurostatâ€™s flash estimate, HICP inflation had been -0.2% in February 2016, down from 0.3% in January, owing to lower annual rates in all main components. Underlying inflation, as measured by the HICP excluding food and energy, had fallen to 0.7% in February, based on the flash estimate, after 1.0% in January. Import prices remained the main source of upward pipeline pressure, although they had been growing less strongly recently, while domestic pipeline pressures had remained subdued.
