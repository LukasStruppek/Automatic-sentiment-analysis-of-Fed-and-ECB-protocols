Members generally expressed confidence in the effectiveness of the envisaged policy package, even though nuanced views were put forward on the relative merits of the various elements of the package. Overall, it was highlighted that the agreed policy package consisted of a comprehensive set of measures that largely complemented and reinforced each other. While the cut in policy rates would impact the whole spectrum of the yield curve, the asset purchases further flattened the curve, with the portfolio rebalancing effects being reinforced by the negative interest rates. At the same time, the new series of TLTROs and the purchases of non-bank corporate bonds would further ease the funding conditions of banks and firms, boosting the pass-through of the monetary policy stance to the borrowing conditions faced by the private sector.
