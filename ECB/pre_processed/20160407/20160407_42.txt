Reference was also made to the continued existence of savings and investment imbalances across both sectors and countries. The view was put forward that these might be exacerbated by elevated uncertainty and the low level of interest rates, which might in some cases adversely affect confidence as well as the expected return on savings, possibly leading to higher savings and lower growth in household consumption, notably in countries where private pension plans and life insurance played a large role. In addition, members expressed concern about the outlook for private investment. It appeared that, despite low borrowing costs and the availability of ample internal financing, firms continued to be cautious about undertaking investments, perhaps owing to the perceived high level of uncertainty and the low potential growth rate. In this context, the argument was made that, for countries with available fiscal space, public investment could be increased, while at the European level there was a need to see more results from the European Commissionâ€™s Investment Plan for Europe.
