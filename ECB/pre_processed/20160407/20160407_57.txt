Members widely agreed that, while the recovery of the euro area economy was expected to proceed, euro area growth momentum would be slower and inflation lower for longer than previously anticipated. This implied yet another postponement of the date by which inflation was expected to return to rates in line with the Governing Councilâ€™s medium-term aim. While much of the downgrade in the inflation outlook was due to falling oil prices and their prevailing future path, measures of underlying inflation were also projected to be weaker than previously foreseen. Concerns were also voiced about the renewed decline in medium-term market-based measures of inflation expectations. Overall, risks of second-round effects appeared to have increased. Moreover, the prolonged volatility in financial markets, amid heightened uncertainty about the global environment and renewed concerns about the health of the euro area banking sector, was seen as a risk to the continued smooth transmission to the real economy of the monetary policy measures taken since June 2014.
