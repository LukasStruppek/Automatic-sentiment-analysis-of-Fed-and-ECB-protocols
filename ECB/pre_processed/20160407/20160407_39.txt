Turning to the euro area, there was broad agreement with the revised growth outlook in the ECB staff projections. The updated projections were generally viewed as confirmation that the ongoing recovery in the euro area economy remained weak and fragile. Against this background, it was observed that the euro area economy continued to be rather vulnerable to adverse shocks. At the same time, the importance of distinguishing between the baseline scenario and the risks surrounding this baseline was emphasised. Although the downward revisions to the outlook for growth were disappointing, the baseline scenario still incorporated a gradual acceleration in economic activity. Moreover, the downward revisions were mostly related to external, rather than domestic, adverse developments.
