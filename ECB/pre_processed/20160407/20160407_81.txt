Against this overall background, and taking into account the views expressed by the members of the Governing Council, the President concluded that a large majority of voting members supported the proposed policy package, comprising a cut in the interest rates on the Eurosystem’s MROs and on the marginal lending facility of 5 basis points to 0.00% and 0.25% respectively, a cut in the interest rate on the deposit facility of 10 basis points to -0.40%, an expansion of the monthly purchases under the APP to €80 billion, starting in April, the inclusion of investment-grade euro-denominated bonds issued by non-bank corporations established in the euro area in the list of assets eligible for regular purchases, and the launch of a new series of four targeted longer-term refinancing operations, each with a maturity of four years, starting in June 2016.
