The euro nominal effective exchange rate, measured against 19 major trading partners, had remained broadly unchanged since the previous monetary policy meeting, with a brief interim episode of a 2.5% appreciation of the euro. This temporary move had resulted from the depreciation of the currencies of the euro areaâ€™s three main trading partners: the US dollar, the pound sterling and the Chinese renminbi. In the case of the pound sterling, the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the UK referendum on EU membership, scheduled for 23 June, had risen and investors in the foreign exchange options market were increasing their purchases of downside protection on the currency.
