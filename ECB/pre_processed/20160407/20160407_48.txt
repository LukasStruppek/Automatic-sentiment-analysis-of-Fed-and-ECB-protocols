Looking more closely at the evolution of the main components of inflation, it was noted that the dominant forces driving the headline inflation rate continued to be global factors, namely lower energy prices and the exchange rate. The volatility of oil prices and of exchange rates had increased recently. It was remarked that the importance of these factors in determining headline inflation could be illustrated by updating the projections with the higher oil price and weaker exchange rate developments after the cut-off date of 15 February 2016, which would result in somewhat higher inflation than in the baseline scenario. However, it was also mentioned that oil prices over the more recent past had been determined not only by supply factors but also by weaker demand, which, if persistent, would not be a positive signal for the outlook.
