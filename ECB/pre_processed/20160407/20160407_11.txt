Global growth remained subdued, with some weakening across regions. The global composite output Purchasing Managersâ€™ Index (PMI) had decreased to 50.6 in February, from 52.6 in January and 53.1 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Global trade had also weakened somewhat further. The volume of world imports of goods had grown by 0.9%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2015, down from 1.7% in the third quarter. The contraction in the PMI for new export orders in February suggested continued weakness early in 2016.
