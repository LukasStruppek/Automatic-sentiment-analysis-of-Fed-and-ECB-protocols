Members continued to view the implementation of the APP as proceeding smoothly. In this context, it was noted that developments at the short end of the yield curve had continued to show divergent dynamics across maturities and jurisdictions. In particular, the short end of the German government bond curve had continued to decline on account of safe-haven flows, high demand for high-quality liquid assets and the start of the APP purchases below the deposit facility rate, as had been explained by Mr Cœuré in his introduction. While these developments had to some degree been mitigated by the enhancements made to the Eurosystem’s securities lending facility, notably to accept cash collateral, they required further close monitoring.
