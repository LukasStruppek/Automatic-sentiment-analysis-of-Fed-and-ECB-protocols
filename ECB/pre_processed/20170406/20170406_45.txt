Members also took note of recent developments in inflation expectations for the euro area. Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, such as the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, as well as market-based measures of inflation expectations, were broadly unchanged. For example, the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had been broadly stable around 1.7% since the Governing Council’s January monetary policy meeting, following an earlier upward trend. Market expectations also indicated that the probability of a deflationary scenario was very low.
