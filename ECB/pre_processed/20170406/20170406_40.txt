Commenting on this outlook, it was pointed out that higher headline inflation reflected the fact that energy prices were 9.2% higher in February 2017 than one year ago, but that base effects were expected to turn negative over time. It was also recalled that the rise in unprocessed food prices observed in recent months was likely to be reversed, while the latest downward movement in oil prices suggested that a continued upward impact of higher energy prices on overall inflation could not be taken for granted in the period ahead. At the same time, it was underlined that the downward-sloping profile of oil prices derived from the futures markets played a crucial role in the HICP projections. In this context, it was remarked that alternative models and tools for gauging the outlook for the oil markets pointed to some upside risks to prices.
