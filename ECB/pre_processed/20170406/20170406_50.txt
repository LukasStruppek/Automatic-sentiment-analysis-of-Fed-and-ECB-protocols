With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction that, while inflation had continued to increase, largely on account of rising energy and food price inflation, underlying inflation pressures had remained subdued and signs of a convincing upward trend were still lacking. There was therefore broad agreement that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation continued to be needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up and to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.
