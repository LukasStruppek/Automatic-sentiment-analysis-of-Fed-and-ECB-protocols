All in all, there was broad agreement among members that the current monetary policy stance remained appropriate. Against the background of a largely unaltered outlook for medium-term price stability, the view was widely shared that patience and maintaining a steady hand remained warranted at the current meeting, coupled with a more confident tone on the underlying economic conditions in the euro area and a reduced sense of urgency for further policy action. A very substantial degree of monetary accommodation was seen to be still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up and durably support the convergence of headline inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This entailed keeping the ECB’s policy rates unchanged, as well as confirming both the intended pace and horizon of APP purchases and the Governing Council’s forward guidance on policy rates and the APP.
