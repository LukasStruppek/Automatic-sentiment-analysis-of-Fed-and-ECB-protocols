The observation was made that credit growth had reached an eight-year high and that the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014, reinforced by the December 2016 decisions, had continued to pass through effectively to the borrowing conditions for firms and households and to credit flows across the euro area. This was supported by continued favourable bank funding costs, even though the scope for lowering bank deposit rates was becoming increasingly limited, with possible implications for lending rates, margins and ultimately bank profitability in the period ahead. In this context, the constellation and slope of yield curves – in conjunction with differences across jurisdictions in terms of the prevalence of fixed or floating rate debt instruments – were seen to merit attention with regard to the consequences for the bank-based transmission of monetary policy across the euro area. At the same time, it was noted that vulnerabilities in some parts of the banking sector persisted.
