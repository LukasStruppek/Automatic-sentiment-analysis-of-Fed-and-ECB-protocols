Against this background, there was broad agreement that risks to euro area activity had become more balanced, while remaining tilted to the downside and related predominantly to global factors. In view of the evolution of recent data and indicators, a number of members considered that risks could be characterised as broadly balanced. At the same time, other members made the point that there were still substantial downside risks to real GDP in view of the fragility of some of the assumptions underpinning the baseline projection and the prevalence of fundamental risks and uncertainties, both globally and in the euro area.
