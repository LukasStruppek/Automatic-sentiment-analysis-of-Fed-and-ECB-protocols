Turning to the euro area, incoming information, notably sentiment indicators, continued to point to a firming and broadening of the recovery. Real GDP had increased by 0.4% quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016, after 0.4% in the third quarter and 0.3% in the second, mainly driven by domestic demand on the back of sustained employment gains and higher labour income. The unemployment rate had decreased further from the fourth quarter of 2016, to 9.6% in January 2017. Private consumption had continued to increase in the fourth quarter and the cyclical recovery in business investment proceeded, benefiting from the prevailing very favourable financing conditions. Euro area export dynamics in December 2016 had been broadly in line with developments in global trade.
