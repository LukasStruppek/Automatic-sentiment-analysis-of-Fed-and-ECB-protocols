Accordingly, there was broad agreement to keep the communication with respect to the Governing Council’s monetary policy stance and its forward guidance unchanged. This implied reiterating that asset purchases under the APP would continue at the current monthly pace of €80 billion until the end of the month, and from April 2017 at a monthly pace of €60 billion until the end of the year and, in any case, until the Governing Council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. This also included preserving the forward guidance on the ECB’s key policy rates and the APP as previously communicated.
