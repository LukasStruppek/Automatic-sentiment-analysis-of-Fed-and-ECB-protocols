Another factor related to the availability of bonds. Flight to quality and, generally, demand for safe assets, had exacerbated the scarcity of short-term safe bonds available to private investors. Bearing in mind that short-term yields of some highly rated euro area jurisdictions had been gradually decoupling from equivalent overnight index swap (OIS) rates for some time, this implied a sustained demand, particularly for German short-term bonds, linked to a generally higher need for safe collateral, in an environment in which issuance had been shifting from short-term to long-term bonds. Beyond regulatory reasons that could explain this development, as shown by acute end-month and end-quarter tensions, other elements might come into play, in particular the demand for safe assets by investors with no access to the ECBâ€™s deposit facility, namely non-bank investors, such as asset managers and central counterparties, which had to invest their liquidity. In addition, non-euro area investors, with no access to the deposit facility either, had to buy bonds to keep liquidity in euro. These elements might have added to the downward pressure on German bond yields. Moreover, since investors now expected higher yields in the United States, there may have been a general reluctance by private investors to take duration risk, which further added to the demand for short-term bonds. Money therefore remained parked at the short end of the curve and was not moving to the longer end, which itself contributed to a further steepening of the curve.
