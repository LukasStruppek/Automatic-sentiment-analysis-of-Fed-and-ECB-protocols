As regards the medium-term outlook, inflation was seen to gradually move towards levels below, but close to, 2%, as also reflected in the March 2017 ECB staff projections, which broadly confirmed the December 2016 projections. However, it was generally felt that, as yet, one could not be sufficiently confident that inflation would converge towards levels consistent with the Governing Councilâ€™s aim in a durable and self-sustaining manner. Notably, the dynamics of underlying inflation were seen still to give scant indication of a convincing rebound, particularly as wage growth also remained subdued. Considering that increases in headline inflation were mainly due to rising energy and food price inflation and that these inflation developments might only be temporary, it was generally still seen as premature to draw firm conclusions regarding implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. Accordingly, the Governing Council was well advised to continue to look through changes in HICP inflation if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability. Moreover, while deflationary risks had largely disappeared and medium-term inflation expectations had recovered some ground, market-based indicators of inflation expectations had remained at relatively low levels for an extended period of time. The assessment was complicated, however, by the presence of risk premia in the market-derived measures.
