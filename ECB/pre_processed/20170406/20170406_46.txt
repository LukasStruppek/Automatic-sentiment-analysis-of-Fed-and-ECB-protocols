Overall, while the outlook for headline inflation had been revised upwards, notably for 2017, owing mainly to higher oil prices, measures of underlying inflation remained low and were expected to rise only gradually over the medium term, supported by the ECBâ€™s monetary policy measures and the continued economic recovery. The Governing Council would continue to look through changes in HICP inflation if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability. At the same time, there was broad agreement that the risk of deflation and of an unanchoring of inflation expectations had largely disappeared. Adverse downside scenarios were thus judged to have become less likely.
