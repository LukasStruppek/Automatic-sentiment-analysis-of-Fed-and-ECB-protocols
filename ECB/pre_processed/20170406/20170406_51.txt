Members expressed satisfaction that the ECBâ€™s monetary policy measures, notably supported by the decisions taken in December 2016, had continued to preserve the very favourable financing conditions that were necessary to secure such a sustained convergence of inflation towards the objective. Financial conditions, overall, had remained broadly stable at very accommodative levels since the first half of 2016, with some further easing seen recently, reflecting mainly an increase in share prices and a weaker euro. This had been offset to some extent by a slight increase in bond yields, largely owing to a widening of sovereign bond spreads in some jurisdictions, which was judged to mainly reflect country-specific factors.
