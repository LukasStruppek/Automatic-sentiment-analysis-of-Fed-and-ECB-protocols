With regard to the global economy, survey indicators continued to suggest a rebound in activity, with some signs of a resynchronisation of the business cycle across major regions. The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) stood at 53.5 in February, close to its long-term average. Global trade was gaining strength while remaining at modest levels. Global inflation had continued to pick up gradually in January, to 2.3% overall and to 1.9% excluding food and energy. Brent crude oil prices had declined marginally since the 18-19 January meeting of the Governing Council, while non-oil commodity prices had increased somewhat. In addition, the euro had depreciated by 1.1% in nominal effective terms vis-à-vis the currencies of 38 of the euro area’s major trading partners.
