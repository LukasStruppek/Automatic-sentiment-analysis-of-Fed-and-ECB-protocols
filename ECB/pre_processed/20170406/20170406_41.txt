It was observed that measures of underlying inflation remained subdued and, according to the ECB staff projections, were expected to increase only gradually over the medium term, supported by the projected continuation of the economic recovery, the gradual absorption of economic slack and the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy stance. Annual HICP inflation excluding food and energy had been fluctuating within a range of 0.7-0.9% since April 2016. At the same time, it was remarked that the impression should be avoided that the ECB’s price stability objective was based on underlying inflation. It was recalled in this context that underlying inflation was not an unbiased predictor of headline inflation, having been significantly below headline inflation and averaging 1.4% since 1999, in the case of HICP inflation excluding food and energy. It was noted that this measure, according to the latest ECB staff projections, would reach 1.8% at the end of the projection horizon, which was well above this historical average and also slightly above headline inflation.
