Members also discussed the outlook for wages and the possible impact of second-round effects. It was underlined that the projected increase in HICP inflation excluding food and energy, from the current level of 0.9% to 1.8% in 2019, was based on a strong pick-up in wage growth. It was argued that a turnaround in wage dynamics was thus the linchpin for the upward profile in underlying inflation to materialise. However, wage developments had so far remained moderate and there was no evidence yet of second-round effects on inflation. As a large number of wage negotiations had already been concluded for this year, it was suggested that the increase in headline inflation seen for 2017 was likely to have a stronger effect on the wage bargaining process only in 2018. At the same time, it was pointed out that the proportion of collective bargaining agreements that included some degree of indexation had decreased over time in parts of the euro area, which might suggest that second-round effects would be contained.
