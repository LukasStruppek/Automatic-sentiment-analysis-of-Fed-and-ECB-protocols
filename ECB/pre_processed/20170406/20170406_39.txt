Turning to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment of the outlook presented by Mr Praet in his introduction. To a large extent, the recent increase in headline inflation reflected an increase in energy price inflation and, in February, was also related to an increase in unprocessed food price inflation. In the coming months headline inflation was expected to remain at levels close to 2%, mainly as a result of movements in the annual rate of change of energy prices. This assessment was reflected in the March 2017 ECB staff projections, where the outlook for HICP inflation had been revised up significantly for 2017 and slightly for 2018, while remaining unchanged for 2019.
