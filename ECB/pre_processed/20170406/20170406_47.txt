As with the discussion on the risks surrounding the outlook for growth, views were exchanged about the extent to which the risks to medium-term price stability had become more balanced. It was underlined that the inflation profile in the March 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections was above forecasts by other institutions and that underlying price pressures remained weak. At the same time, it was noted that the risk assessment might be unduly backward-looking and coloured by persistent past forecast errors, and that such errors would typically change signs around cyclical turning points. All in all, there was broad agreement that both downside and upside risks to the inflation outlook continued to warrant close monitoring.
