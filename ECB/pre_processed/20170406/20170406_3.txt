Turning to the euro area, since the Governing Councilâ€™s previous monetary policy meeting, the aggregate synthetic euro area yield curve for central government bonds and the yield curve for AAA-rated central government bonds had evolved differently. The former had steepened due to an increase in yields at the long end of the curve, whereas the short end of the curve was broadly unchanged. The latter had steepened due to a decrease at the short end, whereas the increase at the long end had been more muted.
