Mr Cœuré then highlighted that the repo market had remained fairly stable over recent weeks. For instance, the decline in the two-year German bond yield on the cash bond market had not been matched by a similar development in the repo market. Also, money market rates and general collateral repo rates had been relatively stable and continued to be mostly driven by structural factors – such as supply and demand imbalances in the collateral market – and, to a lesser extent, by short-term volatility and political uncertainty. The Eurosystem cash collateral facility had been instrumental in mitigating pressures in the repo market.
