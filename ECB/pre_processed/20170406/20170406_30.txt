Members observed that the large contribution from domestic demand – with net trade providing only a small contribution to growth – rendered the economy more resilient to adverse shocks. It was underlined that the forecast for real GDP growth in 2017 had gradually been revised upwards over time, from 1.6% in the September 2016 projections to 1.7% in the December 2016 projections, and then to 1.8% in the March 2017 projections. Including the first quarter of 2017, there were now eleven consecutive quarters of quarter-on-quarter growth above the potential growth rate. The European Commission’s latest Economic Sentiment Indicator and euro area PMIs were very positive, with the composite output PMI for the euro area at its highest level for almost six years. Incoming data had surprised on the upside for some time. The labour market had continued to improve, with unemployment declining steadily and a recovery now taking place in the housing and construction sectors.
