Turning to euro area prices, annual HICP inflation had increased further in February, to 2.0%, up from 1.8% in January and 1.1% in December 2016, reflecting mainly a strong increase in annual energy and unprocessed food price inflation. Excluding food and energy, inflation had stood at 0.9% in February, unchanged since December 2016. Annual industrial producer price inflation, excluding energy and construction, had also increased, to 1.5% in January. While indicators of pipeline pressures were showing tentative signs of emerging upward pressures at the earlier stages of the production chain, domestic producer prices for non-food consumer goods had yet to show an upward trend. Wage growth in the euro area had remained subdued.
