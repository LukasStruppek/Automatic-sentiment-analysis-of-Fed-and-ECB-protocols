On the other hand, the latest data were indicative of the euro area economy gaining cyclical momentum, with the possibility that growth might turn out to be stronger, at least in the short run, than anticipated in the March 2017 ECB staff projections. In addition, it was noted that, although political uncertainty was very high at the moment, some reassurance could be taken from analysis suggesting the effect of elevated political uncertainty on economic activity was not significant. It was noted that other measures of uncertainty which appeared to be more relevant with respect to economic developments remained low. It was also remarked that the relevant benchmark for the risk analysis was the degree to which specific risks were already priced into financial markets. This suggested that, if any of the downside risks under consideration failed to materialise, an upward impact should be anticipated, relative to market expectations, which also needed to be part of the picture.
