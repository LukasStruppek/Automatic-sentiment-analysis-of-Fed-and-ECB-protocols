With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area, provided by Mr Praet in his introduction. Recent data and survey results pointed to the economic recovery in the euro area steadily firming and broadening, supported by the pass-through of the ECBâ€™s monetary policy measures, while sentiment indicators, in particular, suggested that the cyclical recovery might be gaining momentum. Looking ahead, the expansion of the euro area economy was expected to continue to be driven by private consumption, supported by rising employment and wages, and by a cyclical recovery in business investment. At the same time, growth prospects were dampened by the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms and remaining balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors. This assessment was broadly reflected in the outlook for growth in the March 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections. Compared with the December 2016 Eurosystem staff projections, the outlook for growth had been revised up slightly for 2017 and 2018 and was unchanged for 2019.
