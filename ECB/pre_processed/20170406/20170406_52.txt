The argument was made that, as the economy continued to recover and as inflation rose, some indicators were starting to point to an increasingly expansionary monetary policy stance, for example when considering recent declines in real interest rates, in particular, those based on actual inflation. It was, however, also remarked that, while short-term real interest rates had declined with the rise in headline inflation, medium to longer-term rates had declined only marginally since the January meeting. Moreover, it was highlighted that the decline in short-term real interest rates was mainly driven by an increase in energy and food prices. This suggested that any positive impact of a lower real rate was likely to be counterbalanced by a corresponding negative impact of rising food and energy prices on real disposable incomes.
