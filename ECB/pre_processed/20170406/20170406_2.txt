In the United States, financial markets had significantly repriced expectations of an interest rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in March 2017. The probability of a March hike, as implied by the Fed funds futures market on 8 March, stood at 96%, compared with 15% at the time of the Governing Council’s January monetary policy meeting. As a consequence, market expectations of the future path of US rates had moved closer towards the forecasts of the median of FOMC members for 2017, which predicted three hikes in 2017, while longer-term rate expectations were largely unchanged. Separately, on the fiscal side, market participants had scaled down their expectations regarding stimulus from the new US Administration’s fiscal measures and appeared rather to be in a wait-and-see mode.
