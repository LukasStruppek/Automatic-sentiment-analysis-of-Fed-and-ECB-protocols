Members considered the influence of labour market slack on the wage outlook. Attention was drawn to the expectation that, in the context of the March 2017 projection exercise, labour market slack would prevail for longer than previously thought. Moreover, broader measures of labour underutilisation, which took into consideration groups that are marginally attached to the labour market, such as discouraged workers, and the underemployed, pointed to a much higher degree of labour market slack than was evident from the unemployment statistics. This argued in favour of caution with regard to the wage outlook, as the level of slack in the labour market was likely to be an important factor in determining wage growth.
