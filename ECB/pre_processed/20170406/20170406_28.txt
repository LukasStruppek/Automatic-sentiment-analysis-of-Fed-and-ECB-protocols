As regards the external environment, it was noted that the latest staff projections pointed to a strengthening in global growth momentum and a cyclical recovery in global trade. However, the external outlook was perceived to remain very uncertain, with reference made to a number of factors that were seen as contributing to this uncertainty, including the nature and timing of future policy choices by the new US Administration, the economic impact of the United Kingdomâ€™s withdrawal from the European Union, the transition towards lower growth and the rebalancing of demand in China, and developments in other emerging market economies. The balance of risks to the outlook for global growth was generally viewed as remaining on the downside.
