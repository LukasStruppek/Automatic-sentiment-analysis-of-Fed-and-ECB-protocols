On the one hand, it was argued that the projections’ reliance on stronger wages and a declining saving ratio to offset the adverse impact of higher energy prices on real income growth pointed to some downside risk to domestic demand looking ahead. Furthermore, political and economic uncertainty remained high, and it was possible that the negative effects on the euro area economy from external risks – notably from the United States and Brexit – might be underestimated. While there was no clear evidence of a negative impact of uncertainty so far, it was too early to draw the conclusion that there would be no adverse effects on the economy, with the impact of Brexit, for example, likely to become more apparent in the medium term. It could also be argued that uncertainty had not had much of an effect so far because there had been an offsetting impact from monetary policy measures, which had contributed to maintaining favourable financing conditions.
