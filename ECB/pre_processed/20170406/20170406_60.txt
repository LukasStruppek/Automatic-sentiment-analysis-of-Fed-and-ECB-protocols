As regards communication, members generally agreed with the proposals made by Mr Praet in his introduction to keep the communication with respect to the Governing Council’s monetary policy stance and its forward guidance unchanged, while acknowledging that the economic expansion in the euro area had become more robust as the recovery was firming and broadening further, and that the risks to the economic outlook had become less pronounced, though they still remained tilted to the downside. An overall more positive tone in the Governing Council’s communication with respect to the economic prospects of the euro area was seen to be conducive to supporting confidence among businesses and consumers. At the same time, remaining uncertainties and fragilities, notably related to the external environment but also to political developments in the euro area, continued to call for caution.
