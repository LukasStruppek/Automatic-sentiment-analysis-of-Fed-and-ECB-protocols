Looking ahead, it was highlighted that the robustness of real income growth in the staff projections crucially depended on further growth in employment and on nominal wage growth over the projection horizon to more than offset the adverse impact of higher energy prices. It was remarked that at present inflation was driven mainly by higher energy prices, which represented worsening terms of trade and a negative supply shock for households and firms. Hence the baseline outlook for activity embodied in the projections might turn out to be overly optimistic. Moreover, the ECB staff projections saw employment growth as slowing, while a projected strong pick-up in wages was expected to soften the impact of higher energy prices on real income growth. Together with an assumed decline in the saving ratio, this underpinned private consumption growth in the staff projections. The argument was made that the projected strength in consumption was open to question, given its reliance on a future pick-up in wages and the assumed intertemporal consumption smoothing behaviour by households. In this context, it was also noted that the ECB staff projections for euro area growth were slightly above the forecasts published by other institutions.
