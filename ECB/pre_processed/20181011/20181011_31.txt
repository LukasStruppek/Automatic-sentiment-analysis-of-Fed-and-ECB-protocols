Members considered that the outlook for inflation was broadly confirmed by the latest ECB staff projections. Although the headline rate was expected to remain somewhat below 2% over the projection horizon, the inflation outlook was assessed as remaining broadly on track. At the same time, uncertainty about the outlook appeared to be receding. Some encouragement was also taken from recent developments in OECD inflation, which seemed to be picking up. OECD core inflation was currently around the same level as in 2007, and the headline level of inflation slightly above, so that global inflation was also providing support to inflation in the euro area.
