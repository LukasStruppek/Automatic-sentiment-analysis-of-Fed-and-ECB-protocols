It was noted that the recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 was proceeding. The growth of loans to NFCs and households was robust, remaining unchanged from June in both cases. Credit creation was seen to be supported by the overall improvement in banksâ€™ balance sheets, which was also evidenced by the continued decline in the level of non-performing loans. Likewise, lending rates for households and NFCs remained at very favourable levels, supporting credit flows to the private sector.
