Turning to the euro area, members generally concurred with the outlook in the September ECB staff projections, noting that the current projections contained slight downward revisions but no significant change to the growth outlook from the June Eurosystem staff projections. Together with the latest economic indicators and survey results, this provided further confirmation that the ongoing economic expansion in the euro area remained broad-based, proceeding at a pace above that of potential growth. While the pull-back in euro area growth in the first half of the year could largely be attributed to weaker external demand, after exceptionally strong external trade in 2017, the point was made that the moderation in annual rates of growth over the projection horizon reflected convergence towards growth in line with potential. It was underlined that the latest survey outcomes, including those from the European Commission and the Purchasing Managersâ€™ Index, remained at high levels from a historical perspective.
