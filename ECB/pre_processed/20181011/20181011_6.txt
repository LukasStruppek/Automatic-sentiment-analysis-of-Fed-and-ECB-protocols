Finally, with regard to monetary policy expectations, the overnight indexed swap (OIS) curve had shown various episodes of flattening after the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting on 13-14 June 2018, which indicated that markets expected a slower pace of rate normalisation. The expected date of a first increase in policy rates had, however, not changed materially since 25-26 July. A first 10-basis point increase in the ECB’s deposit facility rate was currently priced in for the fourth quarter of 2019, while survey-based information suggested a somewhat earlier timing, which might in part reflect the presence of negative term premia in OIS rates.
