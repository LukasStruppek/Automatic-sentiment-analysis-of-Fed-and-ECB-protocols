With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction. Annual euro area headline inflation had been 2.0% in August 2018, according to Eurostatâ€™s flash estimate, compared with 2.1% in July. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation were likely to hover around the current level for the remainder of the year. While measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, they had been increasing from earlier lows. It was observed that domestic cost pressures were strengthening and broadening amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, which were pushing up wage growth. Underlying inflation was expected to pick up towards the end of the year and to increase gradually over the medium term.
