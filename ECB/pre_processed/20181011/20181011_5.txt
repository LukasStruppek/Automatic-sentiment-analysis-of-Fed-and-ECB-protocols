In equity markets, the EURO STOXX 50 index had fallen by around 5% since the Governing Council’s July monetary policy meeting and was down by more than 10% from its peak in January 2018. One of the drivers of this decline had been European banks, as evidenced by the underperformance of the EURO STOXX Banks index. By contrast, US equity prices had increased continuously since the correction in spring 2018, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 index presently 8% above its level at the beginning of 2018.
