With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction. Broad money (M3) growth had declined to 4.0% in July 2018, from 4.5% in June. Apart from some volatility in monthly flows, M3 growth was increasingly supported by bank credit creation. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth.
