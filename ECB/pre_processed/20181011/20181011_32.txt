In exchanging views about recent wage developments, members noted that there had been a pick-up in wage growth. This was evident in a range of measures, including negotiated wages, compensation per worker and compensation per hour, especially in those countries where the business cycle was more mature. This assessment was supported by evidence put forward for a number of individual countries. Higher wage growth was generally seen to reflect the tightening labour market and was considered a key factor in increasing confidence in the inflation outlook. However, it was also underlined that the transmission of higher wages to consumer price inflation remained uncertain and subject to time lags. In this regard, it was argued that high rates of capacity utilisation could lead to an increase in labour productivity, which might in turn mitigate the impact of wage growth on inflation.
