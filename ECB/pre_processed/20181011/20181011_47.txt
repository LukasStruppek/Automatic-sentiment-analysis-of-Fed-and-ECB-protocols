The Governing Council confirmed that it would continue to make net purchases under the APP at the current monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of September 2018. After September, the Governing Council would reduce the monthly pace of net asset purchases to €15 billion until the end of December 2018 and anticipated that, subject to incoming data confirming the medium-term inflation outlook, net purchases would then end. The Governing Council intended to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
