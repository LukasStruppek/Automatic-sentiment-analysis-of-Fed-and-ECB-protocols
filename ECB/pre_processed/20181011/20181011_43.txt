On communication, members widely concurred with the elements proposed by Mr Praet in his introduction. In particular, it was seen as appropriate to maintain a steady hand in communication, in line with the decisions and communication adopted at the Governing Council’s June and July monetary policy meetings. Accordingly, it needed to be emphasised that the incoming data confirmed the ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy. It was likewise important to stress that risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook could still be assessed as being broadly balanced, in line with earlier assessments, although it had to be acknowledged that risks relating to the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility had gained more prominence recently. Overall, however, it was important to highlight that the conditions remained in place for inflation to move sustainably towards the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim.
