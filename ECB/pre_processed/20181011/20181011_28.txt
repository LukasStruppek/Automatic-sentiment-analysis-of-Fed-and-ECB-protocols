Regarding fiscal policies, remarks were made on the likelihood of a stronger upward impact on euro area growth from a more expansionary fiscal stance, which could be expected in several large countries. At the same time, there was a risk that procyclical fiscal policies could have a negative effect on resilience. The point was made that consideration should be given to the quality of public expenditure and to its impact on potential output. More generally, the current broad-based expansion called for rebuilding fiscal buffers. At the same time, the full and consistent implementation of the EUâ€™s fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remained essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy.
