A number of points were raised regarding the latest ECB staff projections for euro area activity, which had maintained a robust outlook, with only small revisions to the projections for growth. It was recalled that there had now been two consecutive downward corrections to growth, with the outlook for 2018 having been revised down from 2.4% in the March 2018 projection exercise to 2.1% and to 2.0% in the June and September exercises respectively, largely reflecting the less favourable data on the current quarter, while quarter-on-quarter changes in real GDP were limited. In this context, a remark was made that some of the factors behind the revisions might not be entirely of a transitory nature. As regards the projection for euro area export growth, it was pointed out that export market shares were assumed to remain constant over the projection horizon, which could be considered a rather benign scenario. At the same time, it was acknowledged that a large part of the euroâ€™s recent appreciation was due to developments in the Turkish lira, and that the effects were therefore likely to be more heterogeneous across euro area countries. It was also argued that there could be larger spillovers from weaker external demand to domestic demand. Although the effects on investment might have been limited so far, it was not certain that this would continue to be the case.
