Turning to the euro area, recent data indicated that the moderation in the first half of 2018 had reflected a pull-back from very high growth in the previous quarters, mainly on account of weaker export demand. Since the Governing Councilâ€™s July meeting, high-frequency indicators had stabilised and remained at elevated levels, underlining the overall robustness of economic activity. Private consumption had continued to grow at a robust pace in the second quarter of 2018, supported by the ongoing rise in labour income. Strong demand and earnings remained supportive of business investment. Surveys showed that capacity utilisation in the capital goods-producing sector had remained at all-time highs. At the same time, euro area trade momentum had continued to moderate in May. This weakening in momentum reflected mainly a deceleration in extra-euro area trade, especially with Asia, and was concentrated in the trade of intermediate goods.
