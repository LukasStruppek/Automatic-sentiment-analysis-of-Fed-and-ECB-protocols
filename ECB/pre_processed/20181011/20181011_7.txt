Regarding the external environment, the global economic expansion was continuing at a steady pace, at rates close to potential but with substantial cross-country divergences. Inflation and wage dynamics had gained some momentum. At the same time, global trade had decelerated, while protectionist threats persisted. Brent crude oil prices had risen by 8% (in US dollar terms) since the Governing Councilâ€™s July monetary policy meeting, and non-oil commodity prices had fallen by 2.3%. The euro had appreciated somewhat in nominal effective terms but had depreciated slightly against the US dollar.
