Considering the outlook and the risks for the external environment, members agreed that global activity continued to expand at a steady pace. The picture of a continued economic expansion was reflected in the September projections, which foresaw global activity excluding the euro area growing at 3.9% in 2018, before decelerating to 3.7% in 2020, with slight downward revisions in 2018 and 2019 compared with the June Eurosystem staff projections. At the same time, there had been some weakening in trade momentum, and members considered that uncertainties related to global factors had become more prominent, with risks to the external environment generally assessed to be tilted to the downside.
