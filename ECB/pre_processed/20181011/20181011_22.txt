Members discussed in greater detail the impact of trade protectionism on the global outlook. In addition to any direct effects arising from the imposition of tariffs, concerns were expressed about the possibility that trade tensions could generate a more general decline in confidence throughout the global economy. At the same time, it was underlined that adverse confidence effects on trade and investment arising from trade tensions had hitherto been limited and that such effects were subject to considerable uncertainty. Attention was drawn to recent declines in global orders and export orders reported in purchasing managersâ€™ surveys.
