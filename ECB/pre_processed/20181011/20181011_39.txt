There was also broad agreement that the incoming information, despite remaining uncertainties, vindicated the Governing Council’s earlier assessments of progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation carried out at the previous monetary policy meetings in June and July 2018. In particular, inflation was projected to move along the trajectory already contained in the June 2018 Eurosystem staff projections and could be assessed as broadly in line with the ECB’s medium-term objective. Also, while measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, they had been increasing from earlier lows. Comfort was drawn from the strengthening and broadening of domestic cost pressures, which were supported by the ongoing economic expansion, high levels of capacity utilisation and increasing labour market tightness, which was leading to rising wages. Uncertainty around the inflation outlook was receding.
