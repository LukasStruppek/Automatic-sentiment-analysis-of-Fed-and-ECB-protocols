There was broad agreement among members that financial conditions remained very supportive of a continued economic expansion and rising domestic price pressures in the euro area, although they had tightened somewhat overall since the Governing Council’s July monetary policy meeting. In particular, equity prices had fallen in the light of heightened geopolitical and trade tensions. Moreover, the euro’s nominal effective exchange rate had appreciated, although this was mainly due to a weakening of a few emerging market economies’ currencies. It was also highlighted that – taking a somewhat longer perspective – the euro had seen a significant appreciation of more than 10% since the beginning of 2017. At the same time, bond yields had generally been broadly unchanged or had moved slightly lower over most of this period.
