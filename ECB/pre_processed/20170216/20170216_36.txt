As for possible second-round effects, a number of factors shaping wage dynamics merited continued monitoring and further analysis. First, it was recalled that the wage formation process was to a large extent backward-looking in a number of euro area countries. Second, the wage-setting calendar could have a significant impact on wage dynamics looking ahead. However, it was also pointed out that wage agreements were staggered over time and often had a multi-year horizon. This suggested that any second-round effects would unfold rather slowly. Third, labour market reforms and changes in wage-setting processes, including a move towards more decentralised wage bargaining in some countries, could affect the shape of the Phillips curve. Fourth, future wage dynamics would depend on the degree of labour market slack, which was difficult to measure. Fifth, it was seen as worthwhile to examine in more detail wage developments across euro area countries, including unit labour costs, where some divergence in wage growth was to be expected and was necessary for a further rebalancing of competitiveness within the euro area.
