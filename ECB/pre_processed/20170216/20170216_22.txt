Complementing Mr Praet’s introduction on operational issues pertaining to the implementation of APP purchases of assets with yields below the ECB’s deposit facility rate (DFR) “to the extent necessary”, Mr Cœuré recalled that purchases of bonds at yields below the DFR had started on 16 January 2017. Mr Cœuré outlined essentially two dimensions to consider: minimising purchases below the DFR and giving priority to capital key considerations across jurisdictions. There were different pros and cons for each dimension, relating to the impact at the short end of the yield curve, the programme’s impact on the maturity structure and possible communication challenges vis-à-vis markets and the general public.
