Balance sheet adjustment in a number of sectors was seen as continuing to dampen economic growth prospects. In the financial sector, continued progress was needed in addressing non-performing loans and ensuring adequate capital positions. In the non-financial sectors, some further balance sheet adjustment was also likely to be still warranted although it was seen as difficult to identify relevant benchmarks against which to measure corporate indebtedness. It was also highlighted that developments in income and wealth distribution were gaining prominence in the global policy debate, including in relation to the impact of monetary policy measures. In this regard, it was likely that the positive effects of recent monetary policy measures on income and wealth in the euro area, in particular through job creation, overall outweighed any negative effects on distribution, such as those stemming from equity price increases.
