Recent data and survey indicators suggested that euro area real GDP growth was firming and would increase between the third and the fourth quarter of 2016. Developments in survey data, in particular, had been positive overall. The point was made that recent improvements in economic activity remained broadly in line with the assessment of the near-term outlook at the previous monetary policy meeting and with the December 2016 Eurosystem staff projections, while it was also underlined that some recent data had been slightly better than expected, in particular in terms of survey and labour market indicators, pointing to the resilience of the euro area economy in the face of the prevailing high level of uncertainty.
