With regard to price developments, members broadly shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction. Annual euro area HICP inflation had increased from 0.6% in November 2016 to 1.1% in December, driven mainly by a combination of base effects and a recent uptick in energy price inflation, while underlying price pressures remained subdued. The near-term outlook for headline inflation would continue to be shaped by energy prices – with a scenario of a reversal in energy price developments also a possibility – as well as by developments in the euro exchange rate. Looking ahead, headline inflation was expected to pick up further, initially largely on account of base effects and later on supported by the expected gradual economic recovery and the accommodative monetary policy stance.
