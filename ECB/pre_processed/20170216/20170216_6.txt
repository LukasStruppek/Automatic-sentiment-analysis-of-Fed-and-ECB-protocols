The unsecured euro money markets had seen no funding tensions at the year-end, although there had been very strong movements in the repo and foreign exchange swap markets. In the repo market, the search for high quality collateral in a market environment of reduced liquidity had driven rates to record low levels in some jurisdictions. Furthermore, market participants had shown a clear preference for trading repos via central counterparties, rather than bilaterally, over the year-end. Since then repo rates and volumes had normalised and had gradually returned to previous levels.
