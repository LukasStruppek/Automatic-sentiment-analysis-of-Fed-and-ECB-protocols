Regarding further details on how the Eurosystem would buy assets with yields below the DFR under the APP, the Governing Council decided that purchases below the DFR would be conducted only under the PSPP, and, for each jurisdiction, priority would be given to purchases of assets with yields above the DFR. This implied that the amount of purchases that had to be made at yields below the DFR would vary among jurisdictions. This amount might also change over time, reflecting changes in market interest rates relative to the DFR.
