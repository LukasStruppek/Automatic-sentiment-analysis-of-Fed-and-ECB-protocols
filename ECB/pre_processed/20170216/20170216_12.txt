Turning to prices, annual euro area HICP inflation had risen to 1.1% in December, up from 0.6% in November, mainly reflecting substantially stronger energy inflation. Excluding food and energy, inflation had reached 0.9% in December, after remaining unchanged at 0.8% from August to November. Wage growth in the euro area had also remained subdued, with annual growth in compensation per employee increasing to 1.3% in the third quarter of 2016, up from 1.1% in the second quarter. Overall, there were as yet no convincing signs of a more dynamic upward trend in underlying inflation.
