With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly concurred with the assessment presented by MrÂ Praet of the outlook and risks for euro area economic activity. Recent data and survey results pointed to a continued firming of the euro area economic recovery, broadly confirming short-term growth prospects as assessed at the previous monetary policy meeting. Looking ahead, demand growth was expected to continue to be supported by private consumption growth, as well as the continued cyclical recovery of business investment. The balance of risks to the euro area outlook was considered to remain tilted to the downside, owing mainly to uncertainties surrounding the prospects for foreign demand growth.
