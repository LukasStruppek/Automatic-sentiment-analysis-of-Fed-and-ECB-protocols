Measures of underlying inflation had remained broadly stable at low levels since the previous monetary policy meeting. One such measure, annual HICP inflation excluding food and energy, had increased slightly, from 0.8% in November 2016 to 0.9% in December, mainly on account of higher services price inflation. Taking a somewhat longer perspective, it was noted that annual HICP inflation excluding food and energy had been around 0.8% since April 2016. Other measures, in particular producer prices of non-food consumer goods and survey-based selling price expectations, had increased only slightly and remained at low levels. Wage increases had overall remained subdued throughout the euro area and the muted wage dynamics had played an important role in the still broadly stable indicators of services price inflation.
