With regard to financial and financing conditions, the EONIA forward curve had remained broadly unchanged and the overall nominal cost of external financing for euro area NFCs had remained at very low levels. In particular, favourable bank lending conditions continued to contribute to the gradual recovery of the euro area economy. Banks had increasingly been passing on the decline in their funding costs to the economy through lower lending rates. As a consequence, the cost of bank borrowing both for NFCs and for households for house purchase had remained broadly stable at historically low levels in November. External financing flows to euro area NFCs had strengthened overall in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by robust developments in bank lending and market-based financing in October and November.
