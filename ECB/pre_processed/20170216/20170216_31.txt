The balance of risks to the economic outlook was seen as remaining on the downside, with risks related mainly to the global environment, political uncertainties and continued balance sheet weaknesses in some sectors. It was nevertheless also noted that downside risks had receded somewhat, and the case was made that overall the risks surrounding the scenario of a gradually firming recovery were starting to become more balanced. With regard to the prevailing high levels of uncertainty, caution was called for in estimating their impact on consumption and investment as there were other countervailing factors, such as favourable financing conditions, and the impact depended on the type of uncertainty at play.
