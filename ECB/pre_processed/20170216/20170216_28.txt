The economic recovery was continuing to broaden gradually across sectors and countries, as highlighted by Mr Praet in his introduction. While some comfort was drawn from indications of increasing convergence within the euro area, it was also recalled that higher growth would be needed in countries with a large degree of slack. At the same time, it was remarked that a process of rebalancing across sectors and countries should be expected to entail corresponding growth differentials during the adjustment period.
