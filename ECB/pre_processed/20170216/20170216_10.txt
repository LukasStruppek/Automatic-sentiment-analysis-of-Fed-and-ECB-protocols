As regards the financial situation of non-financial corporations (NFCs) in the euro area, the ECBâ€™s accommodative monetary policy stance had continued to facilitate the necessary deleveraging process, as reflected, for instance, in the significant decline in debt-to-assets ratios over the past few years. By contrast, indebtedness remained elevated relative to income or value added. At the same time, the net lending position of NFCs had eased marginally in the third quarter of 2016, while remaining at a high level, and the household saving ratio remained largely unchanged, consistent with a continued strong euro area net lending position overall.
