It was noted that the euro area economy had now been growing at a relatively steady pace for some time, with quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth rates ranging between 0.3% and 0.6% since the third quarter of 2014. Rather than being seen as a source of fragility for the world economy, as in the past, the euro area was showing robustness in the face of external shocks. A question was raised regarding the extent to which euro area economic growth could accelerate further from the current pace on a sustained basis. On the one hand, it was remarked that potential output estimates were currently at the lower end of the range of growth over recent quarters. This suggested that the euro area economy could hit a “speed limit” relatively soon, also in view of the lack of momentum in structural reform implementation in recent years. On the other hand, it was noted that estimates of the output gap remained subject to uncertainty and could well underestimate the degree of slack in the economy.
