With regard to the monetary analysis, members concurred with the assessment presented by MrÂ Praet in his introduction. Broad money (M3) had again expanded at a robust pace in November 2016, supported by its most liquid components as in previous months. Loan dynamics had proceeded on the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014, with loan growth to both NFCs and households increasing in November.
