Turning to the euro area, the economic recovery was firming, mainly driven by private consumption and investment, including construction investment, on the back of sustained employment gains, higher labour income and low interest rates. Real GDP had grown by 0.3% in both the second and third quarters of 2016. The unemployment rate had been 9.8% in November, unchanged from the previous month. For the fourth quarter, survey results pointed to slightly stronger real GDP growth, with higher readings for the composite output and employment PMIs, the European Commissionâ€™s Economic Sentiment Indicator and consumer confidence. There were also increasing signs of a broadening of the recovery across countries and sectors.
