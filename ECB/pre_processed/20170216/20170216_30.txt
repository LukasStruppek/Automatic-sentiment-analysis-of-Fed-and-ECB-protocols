Members underlined that the recent trends and the outlook of a firming and broadening economic recovery largely benefited from exceptionally favourable financing conditions and relied on continued support from the ECBâ€™s monetary policy measures. However, more decisive contributions were needed from other policy areas to ensure a self-sustaining recovery. In particular, structural reforms were essential to ensure sustainable growth and were judged to be particularly desirable in the present context of a firming recovery and favourable financing conditions, as it was politically and economically easier to implement reforms during an economic upturn. With regard to the global economic policy environment, it was seen as important to preserve a continued commitment to open markets and free trade.
