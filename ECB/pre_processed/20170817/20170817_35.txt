Several comments were made on the continued discrepancy between strengthening economic activity and subdued inflation dynamics, which was not unique to the euro area but observed also in other major economies. Reference was made to the speech by the President at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, in which he outlined a number of explanatory factors, such as external price shocks, more slack in the labour market, and lags in the process of wage and price formation. Looking ahead, it was considered important to monitor the extent to which such factors would be transient or more permanent. A number of factors were likely to be of a more structural nature. These included changes in labour markets, work contracts and wage-setting processes, benefiting from the reforms introduced in previous years, which could imply a structural break in the Phillips curve. At the same time, labour market slack was still considerable when assessed on the basis of broader unemployment measures, and a large supply of low-skilled labour could continue to dampen wage dynamics in the near term. The reaction of wages to improving economic conditions could also come with some delay, owing to the backward-looking component of wage and price formation and staggered wage-setting. In goods and services markets, digitisation might put downward pressure on prices over a protracted period. Finally, the relatively slow pace of deleveraging in the euro area could contribute to a delayed adjustment in prices.
