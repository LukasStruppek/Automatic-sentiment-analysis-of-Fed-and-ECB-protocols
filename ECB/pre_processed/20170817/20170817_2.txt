In euro area sovereign bond markets, quasi-risk-free government bond yields had increased measurably after the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra on 26-28 June. This adjustment took place from very low yield levels. For example, before 26 June ten-year German government bond yields had been trading at around 25 basis points â€“ somewhat below the average yield observed in 2017 thus far and significantly below levels seen earlier in the year.
