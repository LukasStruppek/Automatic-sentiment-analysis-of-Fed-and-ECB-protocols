Turning to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation had declined to 1.3% in June 2017, from 1.4% in May, mainly owing to a decline in energy inflation. Excluding food and energy, inflation had been 1.1% in June, after 0.9% in May and 1.2% in April. As yet there were no convincing signs of a sustained upward adjustment in underlying inflation. Price pressures in the early stages of the supply chain remained strong but had still not been transmitted to producer prices at later stages. In addition, domestic cost pressures, including wage growth, remained subdued.
