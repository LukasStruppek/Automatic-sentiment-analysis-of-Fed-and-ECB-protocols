More generally, the point was again made that the overall degree of accommodation was determined by the combination of all the monetary policy measures implemented by the ECB and that the Governing Council’s assessment of progress regarding a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation should apply to the overall design and direction of the ECB’s monetary policy stance as a whole, and not with reference to any particular instrument in isolation, such as the duration and pace of APP asset purchases. At the same time, it was underscored that the asset purchase programme would continue to be a key instrument if the Governing Council assessed the sustained adjustment of inflation to be at risk, while the use of other instruments, within the ECB’s mandate, could not be ruled out. In this context, it was also suggested that the stock versus flow effects of asset purchases be considered.
