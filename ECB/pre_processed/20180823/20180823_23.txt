Regarding the external environment, members concurred with the view that the global economic expansion was expected to continue, although trade momentum had weakened. They furthermore agreed that uncertainties related to global factors remained prominent, in particular with regard to the threat of protectionism and the risk of an escalation of trade tensions. It was remarked that these tensions could generate a more general decline in confidence throughout the global economy, beyond any direct effects from the imposition of tariffs. Concerns were also expressed about the implications for emerging market economies and the recent depreciation of their currencies, with developments in these economies discussed prominently in the IMFâ€™s latest outlook for the global economy.
