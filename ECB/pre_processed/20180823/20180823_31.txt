It was noted that the recovery of credit to the private sector had continued in June, mainly driven by loans to NFCs. The origination of new loans for house purchase had also strengthened further, although, in net terms, housing loan growth had remained moderate owing to repayments of mortgages granted in the pre-crisis boom. The expansion of credit continued to be supported by very favourable borrowing costs for firms and households across the euro area, reflecting also the ongoing pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014. According to the July bank lending survey, loan developments had also benefited from some additional easing of credit standards across loan categories, in particular for households.
