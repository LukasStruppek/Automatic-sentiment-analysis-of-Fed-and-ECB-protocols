With regard to the economic analysis, members shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by Mr Praet in his introduction. The moderation in euro area real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2018 had reflected a pull-back from the very high levels of growth in 2017, relating mainly to weaker impetus from previously very strong external trade, as well as some temporary and supply-side factors. Moreover, the most recent economic indicators and survey results had stabilised and continued to point to ongoing solid and broad-based economic growth, in line with the June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. Overall, the risks to this growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced, despite uncertainties related to global factors – notably the threat of protectionism – remaining prominent.
