There was also broad agreement among the members to highlight that a significant monetary policy stimulus remained necessary for the sustained convergence of inflation to continue, and to emphasise that monetary policy had to remain patient, prudent and persistent. Accordingly, it was felt that the Governing Council needed to reiterate that an ample degree of monetary accommodation would continue to be provided by the anticipated net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by the Governing Council’s enhanced forward guidance. Moreover, in the light of still prevailing uncertainties that could put the sustained convergence at risk, it was considered prudent to restate the Governing Council’s readiness to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continued to move towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner.
