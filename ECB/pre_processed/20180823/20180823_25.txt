Looking at the main demand components, support for the medium-term growth outlook continued to come from strong consumption fundamentals, notably ongoing employment growth. Reference was also made to the probable boost provided by expansionary fiscal measures in some countries. Business investment was expected to continue to benefit from favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. By contrast, the momentum in export demand had eased after performing exceptionally well during 2017, explaining the pull-back observed in overall economic growth. In this context, the point was made that the weaker momentum in export growth and the associated losses in market shares might, in part, also reflect the past appreciation of the euro in conjunction with other determinants of export demand, such as global growth. Furthermore, a remark was made that supply factors might also be contributing to a “structural” levelling-off of economic growth, with a number of surveys pointing to labour market tightness becoming progressively more widespread across sectors and countries.
