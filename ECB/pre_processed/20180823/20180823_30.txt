Turning to the monetary analysis, members agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction. The annual growth rate of broad money had risen in June, partly reversing the deceleration that had been observed between September 2017 and March 2018. While the somewhat weaker momentum in M3 dynamics over previous months had reflected the reduction in the monthly net asset purchases since the beginning of the year, this had been offset by an increase in the contribution of credit to the private sector and other counterparts. Overall, M3 growth continued to be supported by the impact of the ECBâ€™s monetary policy measures and by the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits.
