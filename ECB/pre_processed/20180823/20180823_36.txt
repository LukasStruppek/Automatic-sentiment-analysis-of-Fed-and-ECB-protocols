On communication, members widely concurred with all the elements proposed by Mr Praet in his introduction. It needed to be emphasised that the incoming data confirmed that the euro area economy was proceeding along a solid and broad-based growth path in line with the June Eurosystem staff projections. It was likewise seen as important to stress that risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced, although it also had to be acknowledged that uncertainties related to global factors remained prominent. Moreover, it should be highlighted that the underlying strength of the euro area economy supported confidence that the convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term would continue in the period ahead and would be maintained after a gradual winding-down of APP net asset purchases.
