Summing up, Mr Praet noted that, since the June monetary policy decisions, financial conditions had remained broadly stable and borrowing conditions for households and firms had continued to be very favourable. The Governing Councilâ€™s enhanced forward guidance on policy rates had struck a good balance between being sufficiently precise and maintaining adequate flexibility. Overall, the information received since the previous meeting had been broadly in line with the June assessment.
