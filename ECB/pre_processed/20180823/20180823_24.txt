Turning to euro area activity, members concurred with the view that the easing in quarterly real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2018, to 0.4%, had by and large reflected a pull-back from the very high levels of growth recorded in 2017, with activity still exceeding the rate of growth of potential output. While the most recent data entailed the prospect of real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2018 being somewhat lower than embedded in the June Eurosystem staff projections, the expectation was still that this would be largely temporary and that the outlook over the medium term continued to be consistent with solid and broad-based economic growth.
