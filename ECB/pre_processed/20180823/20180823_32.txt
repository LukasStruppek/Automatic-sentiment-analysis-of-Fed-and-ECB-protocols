With regard to the monetary policy stance, members widely shared the assessment provided by Mr Praet in his introduction. While uncertainties, notably related to the global trade environment, remained prominent, the information available since the previous monetary policy meeting was seen to indicate that the euro area economy was proceeding along a solid and broad-based growth path. The strength of the economy was assessed to confirm the Governing Councilâ€™s confidence that the convergence of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term would continue in the period ahead and be maintained even after a gradual winding-down of net asset purchases. Nevertheless, significant monetary policy stimulus was considered to be still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation over the medium term.
