With regard to price developments, there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by Mr Praet in his introduction. Euro area annual HICP inflation had increased to 2.0% in June 2018, from 1.9% in May, reflecting mainly higher energy and food price inflation. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation were likely to hover around the current level for the remainder of the year. Moreover, while measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, they had been increasing from earlier lows. According to the June Eurosystem staff projections, underlying inflation was expected to pick up towards the end of the year and to increase gradually thereafter. Patience was hence required, given the uncertainties in the baseline inflation outlook. With respect to domestic cost pressures, increasing support for the inflation outlook was seen to come from the ongoing strengthening in wage growth, although it remained to be seen to what extent wage inflation would translate into price inflation over time.
