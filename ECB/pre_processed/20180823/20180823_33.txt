Members widely expressed satisfaction that the communication of the June monetary policy decisions had been well understood by financial markets. Since the June meeting, financial conditions had remained broadly stable and borrowing conditions for households and firms had continued to be very favourable. The Governing Council’s enhanced forward guidance on the future path of policy rates had been effective in aligning market views about the future evolution of policy rates with the Governing Council’s expectation that the key ECB interest rates would remain at their current levels “at least through the summer of 2019”. This formulation was considered to have struck an appropriate balance between being sufficiently precise to provide effective forward guidance and maintaining a suitable degree of flexibility. In this regard, it was remarked that the Governing Council’s expectation was probabilistic in nature.
