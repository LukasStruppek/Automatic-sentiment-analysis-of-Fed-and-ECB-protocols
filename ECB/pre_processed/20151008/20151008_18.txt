Turning to price developments in the euro area, according to Eurostatâ€™s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 0.2% in August, unchanged from July and June. The unchanged headline rate had resulted from a further decline in energy price inflation that had been compensated for by increases in the annual rates of change of the unprocessed food and non-energy industrial goods components. HICP inflation excluding food and energy was also unchanged from July, standing at 1.0% in August.
