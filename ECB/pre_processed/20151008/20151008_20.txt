Import prices remained the main source of upward pipeline price pressure for consumer goods. While import prices stood at elevated levels for non-food consumer goods and, to a lesser extent, for food, domestic sources of pipeline price pressures were still weak. Producer price indices for June and July, which had become available since the Governing Council meeting on 15-16 July, indicated that producer prices for non-food consumer goods had started to increase slightly, standing at 0.2% in July. Although producer prices for non-food consumer goods had been subdued, historical regularities suggested that an upturn was likely, as soon as the pass-through of the strong past depreciation of the euro started to gain traction.
