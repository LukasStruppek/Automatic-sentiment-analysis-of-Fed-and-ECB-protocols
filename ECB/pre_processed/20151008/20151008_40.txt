While the external environment was challenging and volatility had increased, there were a number of factors pointing to the resilience of the euro area. Looking ahead, the cyclical recovery in the euro area was expected to proceed in the second half of the year, with moderate real GDP growth continuing and the output gap gradually narrowing over the projection horizon. The latest economic sentiment data and purchasing managers’ surveys pointed to some robustness of the euro area to external developments, with no significant effects on activity apparent thus far. Among the main factors mentioned, low oil and commodity prices were seen to support purchasing power and the domestic side of the recovery. The steady decline in the euro area’s unemployment rate was another positive signal. Furthermore, it appeared that the process of internal devaluation within the euro area, involving adjustments in prices and costs in individual Member States, was largely complete, which implied diminishing downward short-term pressure on demand and prices in the respective economies, even if different views could be taken on the extent to which further rebalancing was still needed. Finally, fiscal consolidation was also no longer weighing on growth, while the extent of further balance sheet adjustments needed in the private sector was less clear.
