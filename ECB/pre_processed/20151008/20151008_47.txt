Given the recent sharp fluctuations in oil prices, members discussed the factors underlying these developments. Overall, it appeared that the more recent downward movement in oil prices had mainly been driven by supply-side factors, such as increases in OPEC production and resilience in US shale oil production growth, while demand factors related to weaker global growth were also seen to have played a role, with crude oil demand picking up less than supply growth, resulting in further accumulation in inventories.
