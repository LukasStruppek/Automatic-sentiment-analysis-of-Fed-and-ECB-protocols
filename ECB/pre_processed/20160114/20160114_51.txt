Against this background, most members were of the view that a recalibration of the prevailing monetary policy stance was warranted to secure the return of inflation rates to levels below, but close to, 2% and thereby to anchor medium-term inflation expectations. The renewed deterioration in the inflation outlook had further prolonged the period over which inflation remained distant from the ECB’s inflation aim and, hence, had further pushed back the horizon over which this was expected to be achieved. Reinforcing monetary policy at the current meeting was therefore warranted to firmly reassert the Governing Council’s forward guidance and its symmetric commitment to do what was necessary to achieve its price stability objective.
