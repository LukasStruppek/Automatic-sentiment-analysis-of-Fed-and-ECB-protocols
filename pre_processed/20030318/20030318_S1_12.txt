At its meeting on January 28-29, 2003, the Committee agreed on a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate around 1-1/4 percent and retained a balanced risks assessment. The Committee noted that the economy continued to grow slowly, but monetary policy and financial conditions were quite accommodative and the prospects for an appreciable strengthening of the economic expansion over time remained favorable. The Committee concluded that a wait-and-see policy stance was desirable pending an improved basis for judging the ongoing performance of the economy. The Committee's decision was widely anticipated and elicited little reaction in financial markets. However, with the likelihood of war perceived to have increased, investor wariness apparently intensified downward pressure on equity prices and interest rates over the intermeeting period. Treasury bond yields declined somewhat, perhaps reflecting both expectations of lower policy rates and greater investor demands for safety. Rates in private debt markets fell by somewhat more than comparable-maturity Treasury yields. Declines in major equity indexes were amplified by lackluster earnings reports and disappointing data on auto sales, labor market conditions, and consumer confidence.
