Consumer price inflation was quite low at year-end. With energy prices declining, both the consumer price index (CPI) and the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) chain-type price index edged down on balance in November and December. Moreover, excluding the effects of volatile oil prices, core consumer price inflation was held down late in the year by widespread discounting of goods. Consumer price inflation as measured by the core PCE index declined somewhat on a year-over-year basis, while core CPI inflation increased slightly in 2001. At the producer level, core prices for finished goods changed little in November and December, and the index for core producer inflation slowed noticeably last year. With regard to labor costs, growth of average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers picked up in November and December, but the average wage increase for the year was moderate and slightly less than that for 2000.
