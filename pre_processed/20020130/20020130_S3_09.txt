The external sector of the economy was seen as a source of some potential downside for the domestic economy in the period just ahead. Generally weak foreign economies and the recent strength of the dollar in foreign exchange markets were expected to continue to restrain U.S. exports. Economic recoveries in many foreign nations seemed likely over the course of this year, but the strength of those recoveries was subject to considerable uncertainty, and the risk that serious difficulties in some important economies might spread could not be overlooked. Recovery abroad, notably in some key U.S. trading partners, would be tied to an important extent to the course of U.S. economic activity and would not be providing much impetus to U. S. exports over coming quarters. At this point signs of an upturn in foreign trade were not entirely lacking, notably in some high-tech goods, but those indications were still very limited.
