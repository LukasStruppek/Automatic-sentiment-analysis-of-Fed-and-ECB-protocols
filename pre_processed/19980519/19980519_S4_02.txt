[' While a delay in implementing a tighter policy that ultimately proved to be needed to curb rising inflation involved some risks, many of the members concurred in the view that the potential costs of postponing action for a limited time were small. By some measures, inflation had continued to drop in the first quarter, and the appreciation of the dollar, reduced commodity prices, and low--if not declining--inflation expectations would help to hold down nominal wage increases and price pressures for some time, even if, as a number of members suspected, the economy was now producing beyond its long- run potential. Forecasts of rising inflation had proved unreliable and needed to be viewed in light of the considerable uncertainties surrounding them. The members recognized, however, that the longer any needed action was delayed, the more important it would be to take prompt and perhaps vigorous action once the danger of rising inflation became clearer.
