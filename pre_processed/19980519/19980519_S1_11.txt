[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in January and February from its average monthly rate in the fourth quarter. The value of exports declined considerably in the January-February period, with most of the drop attributable to reduced sales to Asian countries. The decrease in exports was concentrated in agricultural products, industrial supplies, and machinery. The value of imports rose slightly, largely reflecting higher amounts of imported automotive products and higher service payments. The available information suggested that economic growth in continental Europe strengthened in the first quarter, with strong domestic demand apparently offsetting the effects of Asian turmoil on foreign trade. Robust domestic demand also continued to buoy the Canadian economy. By contrast, economic activity in Japan contracted in the first quarter and decelerated sharply further in Asian countries that had experienced financial turmoil. ']
