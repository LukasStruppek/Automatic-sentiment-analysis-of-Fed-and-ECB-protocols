[' A number of members indicated that the decision was a close call for them. In this regard, some emphasized that financial conditions were very accommodative in terms of the ample availability of financing to most borrowers on very attractive terms and increases in equity prices. Several expressed concern that the persistence of quite rapid monetary growth this year was symptomatic of a monetary policy that was not positioned to restrain ebullient domestic demand sufficiently, even if short-term real interest rates were quite high. Although some of these members could accept postponing action for the present to await further information on the balance of risks, two members, while acknowledging the uncertainties that surrounded the economic outlook, indicated a strong preference for tightening the stance of policy at this meeting. They believed that current policy was accommodating excessive strength in aggregate demand that very likely would be felt in higher inflation before long. Prompt tightening was needed to avert the necessity of stronger and potentially disruptive policy actions later to contain inflation. ']
