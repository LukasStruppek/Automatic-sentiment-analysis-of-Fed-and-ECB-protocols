[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity has continued to grow rapidly in 1998. Nonfarm payroll employment registered another substantial increase in April after a slight decline in March, and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent in April. However, factory output has changed little on balance in recent months. Retail sales grew appreciably in April, and consumer spending as a whole has been very strong this year. Residential sales and construction also have strengthened this year. Business fixed investment rebounded sharply in the first quarter after having declined slightly in the fourth quarter, and available indicators point to continuing strength over coming months. Business inventories appear to have increased very rapidly in the first quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in January and February from its average monthly rate in the fourth quarter. Despite indications of persisting pressures on employment costs associated with tight labor markets, price inflation has remained subdued this year, primarily as a consequence of large declines in energy prices.
