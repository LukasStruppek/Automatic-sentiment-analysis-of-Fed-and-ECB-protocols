The rapid growth in consumer spending was being bolstered by large gains in stock market wealth; and the strength in housing and other interest-sensitive consumer expenditures also reflected declines in nominal, and perhaps in real, intermediate- and long-term interest rates and the ample availability of loans. Likewise, the ready availability of equity and debt financing on favorable terms was a key factor in the continuing robust growth of business investment.
