[" The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would be sustained at a pace close to the economy's estimated growth potential. Consumer spending was projected to increase at a rate generally in line with the anticipated rise in disposable income; the favorable effects on household wealth of the advance that had occurred in stock prices and the ample availability of credit for most borrowers were expected to balance the damping effects of continuing consumer concerns about the adequacy of their savings, the security of their jobs, and the extent of their debt burdens. Homebuilding was forecast to decline somewhat but to stabilize at a relatively high level in the context of continued income growth and the generally favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership. Business spending on equipment and structures was projected to expand less rapidly in light of some anticipated slowing in the growth of sales and profits. Fiscal policy and the external sector were expected to continue to exert small restraining influences on economic activity over the projection period. Consumer price inflation, excluding the relatively volatile food and energy components of the price index, was forecast to rise slightly over 1997 and 1998 in the context of anticipated high resource use and an accompanying appreciable pickup in the growth of labor compensation that would be augmented by the legislated rise in the federal minimum wage. Somewhat larger increases would have been projected in consumer price inflation in the absence of anticipated technical measurement changes to the index. "]
