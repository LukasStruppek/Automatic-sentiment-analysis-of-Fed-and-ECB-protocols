[' Consumer spending increased appreciably on balance in recent months after a lackluster performance in the summer. Total retail sales fell in November but nonetheless were considerably above their average in the third quarter. The November decline reflected weakness in auto sales; retail spending on other items, notably durable goods, rose significantly further. Spending on services picked up in October (latest data) following a relatively weak third quarter. Housing starts rebounded in November after declining in September and October. Single-family starts in November were a little below the average pace of previous months in the year while multifamily starts surged to a level not seen since late 1990. By contrast, sales of both new and existing homes dropped again in October (latest data). ']
