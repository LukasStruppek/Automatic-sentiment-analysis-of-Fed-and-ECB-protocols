[' Business inventory investment picked up sharply in October from the slow September pace, but total stocks remained at a low level in relation to sales. Most of the October increase occurred at the wholesale level; inventories of farm products turned up sharply after months of sizable drawdowns, and petroleum stocks were built up from unseasonably low levels. Despite the October rise, the ratio of wholesale inventories to shipments remained at the lower end of its range over recent years. In manufacturing, stocks increased at a pace in line with shipments, and the aggregate inventory-shipments ratio stayed at a very low level. Retail inventories were up moderately in October. The inventory-sales ratio for the sector was unchanged and remained in the middle of its range over recent years. ']
