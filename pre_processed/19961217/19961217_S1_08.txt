[' Industrial production rose sharply in November after a small October decline. A rebound in motor vehicle assemblies from the disruptive effects of work stoppages accounted for much of the increase in production in November, but output from utilities also surged in response to unusually cool weather. The production of nondurable consumer goods and business equipment other than motor vehicles also was up significantly in November while the manufacture of consumer durables and defense and space equipment decreased further. Reflecting the strong advance in production, the utilization of total industrial capacity picked up considerably in November. ']
