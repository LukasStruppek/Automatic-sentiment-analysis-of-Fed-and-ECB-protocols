[' The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace. Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably further in November, although the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 5.4 percent. Industrial production rose sharply in November, in part because of a rebound in motor vehicle assemblies that had been depressed earlier by work stoppages. Consumer spending has posted appreciable gains over recent months after a summer lull. Housing starts rebounded in November after declining in September and October. Business fixed investment appears to be growing moderately after a sharp rise in the third quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in the third quarter from its rate in the second quarter. Increases in labor compensation have trended up this year, and consumer price inflation also has picked up owing to larger increases in food and energy prices. ']
