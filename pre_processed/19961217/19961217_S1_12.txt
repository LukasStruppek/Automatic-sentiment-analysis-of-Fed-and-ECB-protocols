[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was somewhat larger in September than in August; exports decreased slightly in September while imports were little changed. For the third quarter, the deficit widened substantially from its rate in the second quarter as exports fell and imports rose moderately. Nearly all of the decline in exports reflected lower sales of aircraft and gold. Increases in imports were widespread but they were largely offset by declines in imports of gold and semiconductors. Economic growth picked up in most of the major foreign industrial countries in the third quarter, but available indicators generally suggested some slowing of growth in the fourth quarter. In Japan, by contrast, economic activity had been sluggish in the third quarter but appeared to have picked up more recently. ']
