[' Open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. However, the federal funds rate tended to average a little above the level expected with an unchanged policy stance in apparent response to scattered operating problems and occasional unexpectedly large clearing needs at banks. Other short-term interest rates registered small mixed changes since the November 13 meeting; Treasury bill rates drifted lower, partly because of heightened demands for safety and liquidity as asset markets became more volatile during the period, while year-end pressures boosted rates on private instruments with maturities in early 1997. At longer maturities, yields drifted lower over most of the intermeeting period in response to incoming data that suggested economic growth would remain moderate and inflation subdued, but they rebounded late in the period in response to the release of firmer economic data and growing concerns regarding the sustainability of current domestic asset prices. Despite these concerns, most major indexes of equity prices advanced further on balance. ']
