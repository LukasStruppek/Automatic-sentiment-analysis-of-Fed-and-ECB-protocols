[' In the Committees discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, members agreed that the retention of an asymmetric directive toward tightening was consistent with their view that the risks remained biased toward higher inflation. Accordingly, while they were not suggesting that policy should be especially quick to react to incoming information over the intermeeting period, they did view the next policy move as more likely to be in the direction of some firming than toward easing. In this connection, some members emphasized that it would be especially important for the Committee to act promptly to counter any tendency for price inflation to rise and for higher inflation expectations to become embedded in financial markets and economic decision-making more generally.
