[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective developments, members commented that the information received during the relatively short interval since the previous meeting had not materially altered either their assessment that the economy was performing quite favorably or their forecasts of further growth at a pace averaging near the economy's potential. The economy currently displayed fairly solid underpinnings, with few imbalances of the kind that historically had tended to create problems. Against the background of generally supportive financial conditions and a high degree of consumer and business confidence, further economic growth was thought likely to be sustained by appreciable increases in consumer spending and business investment. The overall pace of the expansion was expected to be restrained to an extent, however, by declining federal government outlays for goods and services and ongoing weakness in net exports. "]
