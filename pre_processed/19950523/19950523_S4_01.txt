[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain the current stance of policy. The higher interest rates of 1994 clearly had damped demand, but since year-end intermediate- and long-term market rates had declined, stock market prices had risen, bank lending terms had continued to ease, and the dollar had fallen against the currencies of many major industrial countries. On balance, it appeared that the current configuration of financial market conditions and degree of monetary restraint was likely to be consistent with moderate expansion in nominal GDP and prices following a period of some weakness in the economy as inventory imbalances were corrected. The risks of a different outcome, in either direction, seemed to be reasonably balanced. In the circumstances, because the dimensions of the near-term deceleration and the potential strength of underlying demand remained uncertain, the members concluded that it was desirable to monitor developments carefully and wait for additional information before deciding on the next policy move.
