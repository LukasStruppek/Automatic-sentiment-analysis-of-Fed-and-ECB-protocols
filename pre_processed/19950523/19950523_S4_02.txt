[" With regard to the possible need to adjust policy during the intermeeting period, all the members were in favor of shifting to an unbiased instruction that did not incorporate any presumption with regard to the direction of potential intermeeting changes. The members agreed that no compelling case could be made at this point for potential adjustments to policy in either direction during the period ahead, and retaining a bias in the directive would give a misleading indication of the Committee's current intentions for the period. One member expressed the view that the costs of being wrong currently seemed higher in the direction of accommodating too much inflation, though signs of a possible cumulative deterioration in economic activity could not be ignored should they materialize. Another member, who saw the longer-term risks to the economy as tilted to the downside of current projections, indicated that while the recent performance of the economy might argue for some easing of monetary policy, a steady policy course without any bias in the intermeeting instruction was appropriate for now in light of the generally accomodative financial and banking markets.
