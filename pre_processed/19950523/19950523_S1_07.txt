[' Industrial production fell further in April, with manufacturing registering a substantial decline. The drop in industrial output largely reflected a cutback in the production of motor vehicles and parts, but declines in output also were evident in other cyclically sensitive sectors, such as non-auto consumer durables and construction supplies. Production of business equipment other than motor vehicles registered a small gain. Total utilization of industrial capacity continued to decline in April; however, operating rates in manufacturing remained at relatively high levels. ']
