[' The growth of M2 picked up further in April, reflecting in part the need for additional liquid balances to make unusually heavy final tax payments; these payments resulted from the stronger economy in 1994 and from new tax regulations allowing individuals to delay a larger portion of their tax payments until April. The expansion of M2 also appeared to be boosted by the increased relative attractiveness of small time deposits and money market funds following declines in market interest rates. For the year through April, M2 grew at a rate in the lower half of its range for 1995 while M3 expanded at a rate somewhat above its range. The persisting strength of M3 in April largely reflected the needs of commercial banks to fund continuing heavy credit demands by households and businesses. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had grown at a rate a little above the midpoint of its monitoring range in recent months. ']
