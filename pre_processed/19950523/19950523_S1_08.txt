[' Retail sales were down in April after having risen moderately over the first quarter; a steep drop in sales of motor vehicles accounted for all of the April decline. Total expenditures on other types of goods edged higher in April, even though sales of apparel, furniture, and home appliances were noticeably weaker. Housing starts changed little in April after having declined sharply in the first quarter, and the inventory of new homes for sale remained relatively large. On the other hand, sales of both new and existing homes rose moderately in March after sizable declines in February, and recent surveys indicated some improvement in attitudes toward homebuying. ']
