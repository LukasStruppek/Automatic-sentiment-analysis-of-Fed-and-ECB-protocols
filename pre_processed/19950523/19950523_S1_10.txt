[' Business inventories surged again in March, and the pace of inventory accumulation over the first quarter was substantially higher than the average rate for the second half of 1994. Much of the first-quarter increase in stocks reflected a buildup in inventories of motor vehicles at the wholesale and retail levels. Non-auto stocks also increased at a brisk pace in the first quarter, accompanied by the emergence of scattered signs of inventory imbalances in furniture, appliances, and apparel at the retail level and in construction supplies at earlier stages of production and distribution. The stock-to-sales ratio in manufacturing was unchanged in March from the very low fourth-quarter level. At the wholesale level, the ratio of inventories to sales rose in March but remained within the range of the last several years. Inventory accumulation in the retail sector slowed in March despite a further rise in inventories of motor vehicles. For the retail sector as a whole, the inventory-to-sales ratio increased in March to the top end of its range of the last two years; when the motor vehicle components of stocks and sales are excluded, however, the ratio was near the middle of its range in recent years.
