[" The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth of economic activity was slowing somewhat more than previously anticipated, with the recent plunge in motor vehicle sales prompting a deeper-than-expected reduction in the production of cars and light trucks. Economic expansion would average less than the rate of increase in the economy's potential output for a number of months, but the favorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally that had occurred in stock and bond markets were expected to provide underlying support for aggregate demand later in the year and in 1996. The forecast continued to anticipate that consumer spending would be restrained by smaller gains in real incomes and the satisfaction of pent-up demands for motor vehicles and other durable goods. Business outlays for new equipment were expected to decelerate substantially in response to the slower growth of sales and profits. Homebuilding was projected to pick up somewhat in lagged response to the recent decline in mortgage rates. Developments in Mexico might depress U.S. exports further, but mainly in the very near term given the size of the adjustments already evident in the Mexican current account. With this influence waning, sustained growth in the economies of other U.S. trading partners was expected to boost export demand. Considerable uncertainty continued to surround the fiscal outlook, but the forecast maintained the greater degree of fiscal restraint that had been assumed since early in the year. In the staff's judgment, the prospects for some easing of pressures on resources suggested that price inflation would likely moderate from its recently higher level. "]
