[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion of economic activity has slowed considerably further. In April, nonfarm payroll employment was about unchanged after posting reduced gains in the first quarter, and the civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.8 percent. Industrial production fell in April, largely reflecting a cutback in the production of motor vehicles, and capacity utilization rates declined somewhat. Reflecting markedly weaker demand for motor vehicles, total retail sales were down in April after rising moderately over the first quarter. Housing starts were unchanged in April after declining sharply in the first quarter. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to further strong expansion of spending on business equipment; nonresidential construction has continued to trend appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in the first quarter from its average rate in the fourth quarter. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices have increased faster on average thus far this year, while advances in labor compensation costs have remained subdued. ']
