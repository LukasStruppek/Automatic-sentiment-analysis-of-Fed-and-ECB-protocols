[" Members who preferred a more sizable policy adjustment, or perhaps a small move through open market operations that was associated with a rise in the discount rate, believed that the increasing risks of greater inflation pointed to the need to move more promptly and decisively away from a policy stance that had become overly accommodative. A stronger policy action at this point would serve to underscore the Committee's commitment to its price stability objective and would help to counteract what some members interpreted as a significant increase in inflationary expectations since earlier in the year. A reduction in such expectations would over time have beneficial implications for bond markets and the economy. In the view of some members, continued market expectations of further actions to tighten reserve conditions were themselves contributing to market instability. Some members also commented that any policy choice incurred the risk of proving to be wrong, but they viewed the greatest risk at this juncture to be a policy that allowed inflationary pressures to gather momentum. A policy decision that in hindsight led to the implementation of too much restraint could be corrected more readily and with less damage to the economy in this view. "]
