[' Business investment expenditures remained on a solid uptrend as firms continued to focus on the need to control costs and improve operating efficiencies in the face of vigorous competitive pressures. Members also cited some examples of investment spending induced by rising demands pressing against limitations in production capacity. While business investment had tended to be concentrated in new, more productive equipment, nonresidential construction also had strengthened and anecdotal reports from numerous areas tended to confirm more positive nationwide statistics. The rising levels of nonresidential construction activity tended to be concentrated in commercial and industrial facilities and public works projects; the construction of office buildings continued to lag but this sector appeared to have stabilized or perhaps improved marginally after a long period of decline. More generally, currently positive business attitudes augured well for further growth in overall business investment, but on the negative side it was noted that further turbulence in financial markets could erode confidence with adverse implications for investment spending. Residential construction was described as quite strong in numerous areas, although overall housing construction had been held down thus far this year by severe winter weather in numerous parts of the country. Shortages of skilled construction workers and building materials were reported in many areas. ']
