[' Producer prices of finished goods were boosted in February by a surge in energy prices, especially for gasoline and heating oil, that more than offset a further decline in food prices. Excluding the food and energy components, producer prices edged higher in February: for the twelve months ended in February, producer prices increased by a significantly smaller amount than in the twelve-month period ended in February 1993. At the consumer level, higher energy prices in February were offset by lower food prices. For items other than food and energy, consumer prices also rose less over the twelve months ended in February than in the previous twelve months. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased more slowly in February, but for the twelve months ended in February, the advance was about the same as that recorded for the previous twelve months.
