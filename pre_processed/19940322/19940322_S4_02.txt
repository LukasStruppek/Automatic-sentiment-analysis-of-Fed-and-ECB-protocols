[" In these circumstances, the members concluded that monetary policy needed to move fairly quickly toward what might be characterized as a more neutral position. Such a policy posture could not be defined with precision and it undoubtedly varied to some extent with changing circumstances. Nonetheless, it provided a useful conceptual approach to policy in current circumstances and could be identified as a policy stance that sought to foster sustained noninflationary expansion consistent with the economy's potential. The members generally concluded that such a policy stance was still some distance away, and the key issue facing the Committee was not whether but how promptly the necessary policy adjustment should be completed. Whether further tightening beyond that point would be needed later could not be determined at this time but would depend on the potential emergence of conditions pointing to an acceleration of inflation.
