[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity has expanded appreciably further in the early months of 1994. Severe weather and changes in statistical methodology distorted movements in official labor market data in January and February, but it appears that employment increased somewhat on balance over the two months and that unemployment fell. Industrial production also increased substantially over this period after a sharp rise in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending and housing activity apparently have been held down to some extent by adverse weather in January and February: retail sales were little changed on balance over the two months and housing starts fell considerably. Trends in contracts and orders point to a sizable increase in business fixed investment but at a rate well below that for the fourth quarter of 1993. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services in January was slightly smaller than the average in the fourth quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices have remained moderate in recent months despite a surge in energy prices. ']
