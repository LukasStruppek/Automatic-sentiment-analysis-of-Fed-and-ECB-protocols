[' Retail sales were little changed on balance over the first two months of the year, with sales recovering in February from a large January decline. By contrast, sales of motor vehicles remained quite brisk on average over the two months, despite the California earthquake and the severe weather. Soaring outlays for home heating contributed to rapid growth of consumer spending on services in January. The unusual weather also affected housing activity; starts were down considerably in January and February from the very high levels of late 1993, and new home sales plunged in January. Sales of existing homes in January were only slightly below their high December level. ']
