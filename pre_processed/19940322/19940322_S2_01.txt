[' The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic expansion would slow from the very strong pace of the fourth quarter but that the economy would advance in 1994 at a rate slightly in excess of the growth of potential. Consumer spending, which had tended for some time to outpace income growth, was projected to increase at a rate more in line with disposable incomes; spending on durable goods, in particular, was projected to slow markedly as stock-adjustment motives diminished and higher interest rates exerted some restraint. Business fixed investment was expected to increase less rapidly in 1994, reflecting the diminishing effect of the earlier pickup in output growth and the slower growth of corporate cash flow. Homebuilding activity was anticipated to continue at a relatively brisk pace, spurred by the greater cash-flow affordability of housing and the good prospects for continued growth in employment and incomes. The restraint on output growth from federal spending cutbacks and weak export demand was projected to diminish somewhat. In light of the limited margins of slack in labor and product markets that were expected to prevail over the forecast horizon, little further reduction in the core rate of inflation was expected. ']
