[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services, measured on the new balance-of-payments basis, was slightly smaller in January than the average for the fourth quarter. However, the January deficit was substantially larger than that of December, with exports down by more than imports. Much of the reduction in exports was in agricultural goods, aircraft, and gold; the drop in imports mainly reflected both lower quantities and lower prices of imported oil. The limited available data suggested that economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries picked up in early 1994 after a mixed performance in the fourth quarter of 1993. ']
