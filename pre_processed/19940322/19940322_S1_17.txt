[' M2 declined somewhat and M3 was down sharply in February. A substantial drop in mortgage refinancings since late 1993 that depressed demand deposits, and to a lesser extent savings deposits, contributed to the weakness of M2 in February. M3 also was affected by a precipitous decline in institution-only money funds as investors reacted quickly following the monetary tightening to widening spreads between returns on these funds and higher-yielding short-term instruments. Data for early March pointed to some rebound in both monetary aggregates, perhaps owing to portfolio readjustments that involved sizable net redemptions of bond funds and apparently-weaker inflows to stock funds. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a moderate rate in recent months. ']
