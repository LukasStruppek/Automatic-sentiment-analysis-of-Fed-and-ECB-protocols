[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members supported a further move toward a less accommodative policy stance. An initial move in that direction had been made in early February, but the members still viewed monetary policy as too stimulative. In this regard, members cited the very low inflation-adjusted interest rates in short-term debt markets as an indicator of excessive policy accommodation, and one member also referred to the rapid growth in reserves and narrow measures of money over an extended period. While a quite accommodative policy stance had been entirely appropriate earlier in the economic recovery, when constraints such as the widespread rebuilding of balance sheets and business restructuring activities were strongly inhibiting the expansionary forces in the economy, those constraints had greatly diminished and the expansion clearly had gained considerable momentum. In the circumstances, maintaining an accommodative monetary policy could be expected before too long to foster growing pressures on labor and capital resources with a resulting pickup in inflation. While actual inflation remained subdued and credit growth was still damped, it was only a matter of time before the current monetary policy induced a surge in credit extensions that could fuel an outbreak of inflation.
