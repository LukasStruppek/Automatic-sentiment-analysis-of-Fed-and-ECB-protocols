[' Members assessed the outlook for economic activity and prices against the backdrop of sharp changes in bond and, to a lesser extent, equity prices over the intermeeting period. Clearly, the tightening of reserve conditions announced on February 4 had played a role in market movements, but other factors had been at work as well. Members variously stressed the possibility that the backup in interest rates had reflected much stronger aggregate demand, added uncertainty about the course of interest rates, influences from foreign exchange and foreign capital markets, changes in trading strategies by wary participants, and rising inflation expectations. On balance, financial conditions were still seen as supportive of solid economic expansion, and a number of members referred in particular to the more accommodative lending policies of many depository institutions; however, some commented on the risk, which they viewed as having a low probability, that weakness and volatility in financial markets could at some point have a significantly inhibiting effect on business and consumer confidence and spending. To date, business sentiment was described as quite positive in most parts of the country, and although there were some exceptions--notably in California--members commented on numerous indications of improving regional economies.
