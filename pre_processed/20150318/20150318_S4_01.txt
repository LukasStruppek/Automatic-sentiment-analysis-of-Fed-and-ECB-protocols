 In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in January indicated that economic growth had moderated somewhat Labor market conditions had improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate; a variety of labor market indicators suggested that the underutilization of labor resources continued to diminish Household spending was rising moderately, with declines in energy prices boosting household purchasing power Business fixed investment was advancing, although the recovery in the housing sector remained slow and export growth had weakened Inflation had declined further below the Committee's longer-run objective, largely reflecting the declines in energy prices Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had been stable The Committee expected that, with appropriate monetary policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would continue to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate The Committee also expected that inflation would remain near its recent low level in the near term but rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of energy price declines and other factors dissipate In light of the uncertainties attending the outlook for inflation, the Committee agreed that it should continue to monitor inflation developments closely
