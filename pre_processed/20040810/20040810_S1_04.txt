Growth in employment slowed in June and July after displaying significant improvement in preceding months. The weakness was reported to be widespread, with the retail trade, information, financial activities, and government sectors registering declines on average over the two months. The construction and services sectors posted gains, but at a pace well below those of previous months. In contrast, after little change in June, payrolls in manufacturing rose appreciably in July. The average workweek declined in June but edged up in July, and aggregate hours of private production workers showed a similar pattern. Labor force participation moved up slightly in recent months, and the unemployment rate, which was unchanged in June, edged down to 5-1/2 percent in July.
