Growth in consumer spending slowed sharply in the second quarter, posting only a small increase after a robust expansion in the first quarter. Although gains in outlays for services continued at a solid rate in the second quarter, expenditures for goods declined markedly. Data on consumer expenditures showed particular weakness in June, with either declines or no growth in purchases across most categories of goods and services. Purchases of cars and trucks contracted in that month but rebounded in July. Real disposable income was unchanged in June, held back by increases in prices of food and, especially, energy.
