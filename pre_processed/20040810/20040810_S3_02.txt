Committee members generally agreed that higher energy prices had played an important role in the recent moderation of economic growth. While the direct effect of higher energy prices on real disposable income could account for only a relatively small part of the reduction in the growth of consumer spending, some members suggested that those effects may have been exacerbated by substantial increases in expected future energy costs as well as greater uncertainty about those costs. Moreover, the economy seemed to have responded in some past episodes to sharp increases in energy costs by much more than could be explained by most models. Still, some Committee members doubted that higher energy prices were sufficient to explain all of the recent slowdown in spending. Effects of increased energy prices on consumer and business confidence, which might have led to a larger spending response, had not been evident, and the consequences for growth in other industrialized countries dependent on imported oil appeared to have been fairly modest thus far. Informed in part by prices in futures markets, Committee members anticipated that energy costs would level out and perhaps fall back from their recent highs, but they noted that there was considerable uncertainty about that outlook.
