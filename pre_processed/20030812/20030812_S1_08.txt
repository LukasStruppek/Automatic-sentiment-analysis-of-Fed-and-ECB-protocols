Business outlays on equipment and software jumped in the second quarter following a lackluster performance over the preceding half year. Spending on computers and software accelerated sharply, and purchases of communications equipment increased considerably. The transportation category, by contrast, contracted as business spending on motor vehicles stagnated and investment in aircraft decreased. Data on orders and shipments for nondefense capital goods in June pointed to growth in nearly all categories. Expenditures on nonresidential structures turned up in the second quarter as increases in spending on institutional and other structures more than offset declines in expenditures for office and industrial buildings. Office building vacancy rates changed little in the second quarter, while vacancies in industrial buildings rose to record levels.
