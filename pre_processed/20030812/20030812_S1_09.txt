The U.S. international trade deficit edged up in May as imports of goods and services increased slightly more than exports. Recent data generally indicated that growth in foreign industrial countries was weak in the second quarter. The economies of Japan and the euro area appeared to have remained stagnant. Canadian economic growth was held back by both the SARS outbreak and the discovery of mad cow disease, although a rebound in employment in June suggested that the weakness was temporary. GDP growth in the United Kingdom showed a moderate rebound in the second quarter.
