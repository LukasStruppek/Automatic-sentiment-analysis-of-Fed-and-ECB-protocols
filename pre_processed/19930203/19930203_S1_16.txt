[" After expanding at a moderate pace over the course of earlier months, M2 contracted in December and January. Some of the weakness reflected a slowdown in Ml growth associated with lower mortgage refinancing activity. Within M2's nontransaction component, the expansion of savings and money market deposit accounts slowed abruptly, perhaps owing in part to the wider spread that had developed during the fall between market rates and those paid on these accounts, as well as to the use of monies in these accounts to fund a step-up in consumer purchases and nonwithheld tax payments. In addition, the continued attractiveness to investors of bond and stock mutual funds might have contributed to a quickening of the runoff of holdings of money market mutual funds and to the persisting weakness in other M2 accounts. Appreciable declines in M3 in December and January reflected both the contraction in M2 and reduced needs by banks for managed liabilities at a time of weak overall credit demand. From the fourth quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992, both M2 and M3 grew at rates somewhat below the lower ends of the Committee's annual ranges. Total domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have expanded at the lower end of the Committee's monitoring range for 1992. "]
