[" A staff analysis prepared for this meeting suggested a resumption of some growth in the broad measures of money later in the first quarter but a decline in both M2 and M3 for the quarter as a whole. While part of the declines appeared to reflect difficulties with seasonal adjustments and the ebbing of special factors that previously had boosted growth, the uncertainties surrounding the behavior of these aggregates tended to reduce their role in current monetary policy. Nevertheless, there was concern about the persisting weakness in the broad aggregates, including the likelihood that they would fall well short of the Committee's new ranges over the first part of the year. Some members also noted that the growth of Ml, while still fairly robust in December and January, was markedly below its pace over most of 1992. On the other hand, bank loans had increased in recent months, and the weakness in the monetary aggregates did not appear to reflect underlying softness in the economy. In these circumstances, a number of members believed that any effort to stimulate monetary growth under immediately prevailing economic conditions and market expectations might well prove to be counterproductive. An easing at this time could accelerate outflows from interest-sensitive M2 assets if the easing were seen as signaling a weakening of the System's anti-inflationary resolve and were to result in higher rates on intermediate- and long-term debt securities.
