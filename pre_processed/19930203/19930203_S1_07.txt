[' Consumer spending was up substantially in the fourth quarter. Retail sales, after rising sharply in October and changing little in November, posted a further sizable increase in December. The largest sales gains in the fourth quarter were reported at automotive dealers and at building material and supply outlets, but most other types of retail stores also recorded higher sales. By contrast, consumer spending for services, as indicated by data on personal consumption expenditures, rose more slowly. Housing starts surged in December, with single family starts reaching their highest level in nearly three years and multifamily starts picking up slightly from the very low levels of October and November. Sales of new and existing homes remained on a strong upward trend in December. ']
