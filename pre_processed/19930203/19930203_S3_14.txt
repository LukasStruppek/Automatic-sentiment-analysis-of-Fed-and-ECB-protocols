[' All of the members agreed that it would be desirable to retain the monitoring range of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent that the Committee had established on a provisional basis for the growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt in 1993. The expansion in such debt had not been damped by special forces to the same extent as the broad monetary aggregates in 1992. Over the year ahead, growth in the federal debt was likely to remain substantial, and the expansion of debt in the nonfederal sectors was projected to accelerate somewhat given the continued improvement in borrower balance sheets and an anticipated increase in the willingness of financial institutions to lend as the economy continued to expand. Nonetheless, in the context of still cautious attitudes on the part of both borrowers and lenders, the growth of nonfederal debt probably would remain below that of nominal GDP in the year ahead. ']
