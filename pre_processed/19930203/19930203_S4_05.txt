[" M2 appears to have contracted in December and January, after expanding at a moderate pace over the course of previous months; M3 is estimated to have declined appreciably in both months. From the fourth quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992, both M2 and M3 grew at rates somewhat below the lower ends of the Committee's annual ranges for 1992. Total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have expanded at the lower end of the Committee's monitoring range for the year. "]
