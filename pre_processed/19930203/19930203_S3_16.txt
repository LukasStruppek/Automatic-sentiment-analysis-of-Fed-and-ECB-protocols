[' Turning to policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all of the members endorsed a proposal to maintain unchanged conditions in reserve markets, and all indicated that they could accept a directive that did not incorporate any presumption with regard to the likely direction of possible intermeeting adjustments to policy. While there was concern about the weakness in the monetary aggregates, the members generally agreed that recent economic developments tended to reinforce the view that monetary policy was on an appropriate course. The economy seemed to be on a stronger growth track than earlier in the expansion, and inflation remained quite subdued--only a bit above some estimates of price stability--and likely to moderate further in coming quarters in the view of most members. Some commented that a further easing move at this juncture might well have adverse effects on inflation sentiment and on interest rates in intermediate- and long-term debt markets. A few referred to the recent firming in some commodity prices and the consensus among private forecasters that inflation could drift higher over the next few years. In the view of one member, these developments might argue for a tilt in the directive toward possible restraint, but they did not call for an immediate tightening in reserve conditions. ']
