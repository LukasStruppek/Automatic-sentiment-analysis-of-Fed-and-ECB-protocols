[' In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt aggregates, the Committee members and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had prepared projections of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and inflation for 1993. The central tendencies of the forecasts pointed to slightly faster economic growth this year than currently seemed to have occurred in 1992. The anticipated rate of economic expansion would be at a pace that was rapid enough to reduce the rate of unemployment a little further. Nonetheless, with some slack in productive resources persisting, price and cost pressures would remain subdued and modest additional moderation in inflation was expected by most members. Measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993, the forecasts for growth of real GDP had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/4 percent within a full range of 2-1/2 to 4 percent. Projections of the civilian rate of unemployment in the fourth quarter of 1993 were concentrated in the upper half of a 6-1/2 to 7 percent range. For the CPI, the central tendency of the forecasts for the period from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993 was centered on increases in a range of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent, and for nominal GDP the forecasts were clustered in a range of 5-1/2 to 6 percent for the year.
