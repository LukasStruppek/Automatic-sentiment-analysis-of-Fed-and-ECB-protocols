[" The deviations in monetary growth from historical norms reflected a number of developments whose relative importance and intensity had shifted to some extent over the course of recent years, but in general they had served to rechannel funds away from depository institutions, and the associated weakness in deposit growth had raised velocity--the ratio of nominal GDP to money. The result was the need for lower money growth than in the past to support a given rate of income growth. Among the developments that had tended to retard the relative growth of M2 and M3 was the unprecedented steepness of the yield curve that had prompted large shifts of funds by savers from M2 accounts to higher-yielding intermediate- and long-term assets. At the same time, credit growth at bank and thrift depository institutions had been weak, partly as a result of efforts by these institutions to improve capital and liquidity positions, and partly owing to weak demand. As a consequence, they also had maintained relatively low offering rates on deposits that had provided consumers with an incentive to reduce or hold down their deposit holdings in order to pay down relatively high cost mortgages and other debts. In 1992, sluggish growth of M2 and M3 had been associated with a considerable acceleration in nominal spending. Indeed, despite growth of both M2 and M3 at rates below the Committee's ranges, the expansion of the economy had exceeded most forecasts. "]
