[" The increasing signs of slow growth or recession in a number of foreign nations represented a greater downside risk to the demand for U.S. exports than had been apparent earlier. It was noted, for example, that firms engaged in business activities abroad were reporting substantial deterioration in markets for U.S. goods in many foreign countries. Growth in U.S. exports might remain positive over the year ahead, but against the background of a relatively expansive U.S. economy and the dollar's recent appreciation, the value of exports might well fall increasingly short of that of imports with adverse effects on the growth of U.S. economic activity.
