[' In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates in 1993 that it had established on a tentative basis at its meeting on June 30-July 1, 1992. The tentative ranges included expansion of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for M2 and 1 to 5 percent for M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had been set provisionally at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for 1993. All of these ranges were unchanged from those that the Committee had set for 1992 at its meeting in February of last year and had reaffirmed at mid-year. When the provisional ranges for money growth were established, the Committee had noted that they were especially tentative and subject to revision in the latter part of 1992 or early 1993 owing to the considerable uncertainty about the evolving relationship of money to income.
