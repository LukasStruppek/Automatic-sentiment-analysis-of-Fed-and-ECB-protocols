[' A small November decline in producer prices of finished goods was reversed in December, with a rebound in prices of finished foods outweighing a further drop in energy prices. For finished items other than food and energy, producer prices rose in December, but the advance followed six months of no change on balance; for 1992 as a whole, this measure of prices increased by a considerably smaller amount than in 1991. At the consumer level, the index for prices of nonfood, non-energy items edged higher in December after somewhat larger increases in the two preceding months. The rise in this index in 1992 was the smallest for any year since the early 1970s, when wage and price controls were in effect. Hourly compensation of private industry workers advanced a little more rapidly in the fourth quarter than in the two previous quarters, but the rise in total compensation over the year as a whole was considerably smaller than in 1991. The slowing of labor cost increases last year occurred in both the wages and benefits components. ']
