[" The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that economic activity rose appreciably further in the fourth quarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment registered another small increase in December, and the civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent. Industrial production posted solid gains over the closing months of the year. Retail sales were up substantially in the fourth quarter, and residential construction activity increased sharply. Indicators of business fixed investment suggest a notable gain in recent months, particularly for producers' durable equipment. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed slightly in October-November from its average rate in the third quarter. Recent data on wages and prices have been mixed but they continue to suggest on balance a trend toward lower inflation. "]
