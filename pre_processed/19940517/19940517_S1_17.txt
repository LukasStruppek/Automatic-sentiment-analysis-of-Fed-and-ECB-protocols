[' Growth of M2 and M3 turned up, on balance, in March and April despite the rising short-term opportunity costs of holding deposits. The strengthening of these aggregates seemed to be related to a reassessment by households of the relative attractiveness of investing in capital market instruments; capital losses sparked substantial net redemptions at bond mutual funds over March and April that were accompanied by a surge in flows to retail money market funds and slower runoffs of small time deposits. For the year through April, M2 expanded at a rate somewhat below the middle of its range for 1994, and M3 at a pace somewhat above the lower end of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a moderate rate over recent months. ']
