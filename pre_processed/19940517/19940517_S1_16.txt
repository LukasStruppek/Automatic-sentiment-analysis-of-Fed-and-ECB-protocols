[" In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat further on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar's depreciation occurred despite the implementation of less accommodative policy actions in the United States and monetary easing moves in several key foreign countries. Market concerns about political developments in Japan as well as a worsened outlook for progress toward more open trading relationships and for a more stimulative fiscal policy in that country contributed to downward pressure on the dollar. Against the backdrop of a falling dollar, U.S. authorities conducted intervention operations on April 29 and again on May 4. The latter operations were coupled with a statement by Treasury Secretary Bentsen indicating that intervention was being undertaken in response to recent movements in exchange markets that had gone beyond what could be justified by economic fundamentals and was being conducted in concert with operations by other major countries. Subsequent to these actions, the dollar retraced part of its earlier decline. "]
