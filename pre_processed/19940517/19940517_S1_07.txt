[' Retail sales were estimated to have fallen in April after two months of very large increases. Despite the April decline, which was widespread by type of retail outlet, outlays were considerably above the first-quarter average. Sales of new and existing homes posted significant gains in March although they remained below their fourth-quarter averages. Housing starts decreased slightly in April but were well above the depressed winter pace. The third consecutive monthly gain in multifamily starts was more than offset by a decline in single-family starts. ']
