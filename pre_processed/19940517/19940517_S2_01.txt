[" The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity, after rebounding from the disruptions caused by adverse weather conditions earlier in the year, would expand in the second half of 1994 at a rate close to the growth of the economy's potential. Consumer spending, which had outpaced gains in household income for some time, was projected to slow to a growth rate more in line with the expansion of income; with pent-up demands apparently reduced and somewhat higher interest rates exerting a damping effect, much of the slowing was expected to be centered on outlays for durable goods. Business fixed investment would be restrained by the slower growth of business output and the associated moderation of corporate cash flows but would continue to advance at a faster rate than overall economic activity. Homebuilding was projected to remain at a pace that was relatively robust compared with the rate of recent years, though a bit below that of the fourth quarter. The restraint on output growth from federal spending cutbacks and weak export demand was expected to diminish somewhat. In light of limited margins of slack in labor and product markets over the forecast horizon, little or no further reduction in the core rate of inflation was anticipated. "]
