[" In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the period until the meeting in early July, the members favored prompt further action to remove much of the remaining accommodation in the stance of monetary policy, at least as measured by real short-term interest rates. Many members commented that the expansion was on a solid and self-sustaining basis and appeared to have more underlying strength than they had foreseen earlier. The stimulative effects of an expansionary monetary policy had become increasingly apparent--especially in business purchases of capital equipment and consumer spending on housing, motor vehicles, and other consumer durables. At the same time, the constraints on economic expansion that had been associated with business restructuring activities, widespread efforts to strengthen balance sheets, and other retarding forces had diminished considerably. The financial health of the banking system was greatly improved, and banking institutions had evidenced a growing willingness to make new loans. Moreover, the demand for bank loans, which had been sluggish for several years, now appeared to be on the rise. While a series of small steps earlier this year had already reduced the degree of accommodation in monetary policy and inflation was subdued for the time being, the members were concerned that continued policy accommodation could be expected to lead before long to growing pressures on production resources and to a fresh outbreak of inflation.
