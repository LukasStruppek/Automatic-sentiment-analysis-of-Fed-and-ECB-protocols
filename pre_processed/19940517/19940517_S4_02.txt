[" In the circumstances, all the members agreed that a further tightening action was needed at this point; and, in order to better assure that the remaining degree of policy accommodation had been largely removed, the adjustment should fully reflect the 1/2 percentage point increase in the discount rate that the Board of Governors was expected to approve later in the day. The actions taken earlier in the year had been modest in size because of concerns that more aggressive steps might generate substantial uncertainty and undue disruptions in financial markets, with adverse consequences for the economy. Even though financial markets remained volatile, speculative sentiment and holdings seemed to have been reduced to a marked extent, and financial markets appeared to be in a much better position to absorb needed policy adjustments. Accordingly, a stronger action probably would not produce an unduly adverse market response and could well have a settling effect on the markets. A number of members cautioned that the Committee could not be sure that today's policy actions, along with those implemented earlier this year, had produced a policy stance that would foster economic growth at a sustainable, non-inflationary pace. Thus, the Committee would have to remain alert to economic and financial developments that might signal the need for further tightening. "]
