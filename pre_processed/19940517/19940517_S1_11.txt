[' Indexes of consumer and producer prices had increased slightly thus far in 1994. In April, consumer prices posted their smallest rise since January; food prices were up a bit further, but energy prices retraced their March run-up. Excluding the food and energy components of the index, consumer prices edged up in April, and over the twelve months ending in April these prices increased less than they had over the previous twelve months. Producer prices of finished goods declined a little in April as prices of finished foods and energy moved down; for items other than food and energy, prices were up slightly in April and for the twelve months ending in April. At earlier stages of processing, the index of producer prices of crude materials other than food and energy was substantially above its year-ago level, despite a small drop in April. At the intermediate stage, the prices of some important construction materials had increased sharply although, overall, prices of nonfood, non-energy goods had risen only modestly over the past twelve months.
