[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity has expanded substantially on balance thus far in 1994. Nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply in March and April, in part reflecting a rebound in sectors affected by severe winter weather; the civilian unemployment rate fell slightly further in April, to 6.4 percent. Industrial production was up appreciably in April after a strong rise over the previous two quarters. Advance data on retail sales indicate a decline in April, after very large increases in February and March. Housing starts fell slightly in April but remained well above the depressed winter pace. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong uptrend in spending on business equipment, while nonresidential building has shown some recovery after severe weather disrupted construction during January and February. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened on average in January and February from the fourth-quarter rate. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices remained moderate through April, though prices of industrial materials continued to rise. ']
