 The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) provided a summary of developments in domestic and global financial markets over the intermeeting period Developments in emerging market economies (EMEs) and in Europe were the focus of considerable attention by financial market participants over recent weeks Investor perceptions of increased economic and political vulnerabilities in several EMEs led to a notable depreciation in EME currencies relative to the dollar Market participants reported that an unwinding of investor positions had been a factor amplifying these currency moves In Europe, concerns about the political situation in Italy and its potential economic implications prompted a significant widening in risk spreads on Italian sovereign securities The share prices of Italian banks and other banks that could be exposed to Italy declined sharply In domestic financial markets, expectations for the path of the federal funds rate were little changed over the intermeeting period The manager noted that the release of the minutes of the May FOMC meeting, and particularly the reference to a possible technical adjustment in the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate relative to the top of the FOMC's target range for the federal funds rate, prompted a small reduction in federal funds futures rates
