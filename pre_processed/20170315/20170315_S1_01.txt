 The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in US and global financial markets during the period since the Committee met on January 31 and February 1, 2017 Global equity prices generally increased further, credit spreads on corporate debt and emerging market bonds narrowed, and yields on Treasury securities rose somewhat In survey responses, market participants again reported elevated uncertainty about the outlook for US economic policies and about financial asset prices, but various measures of implied volatility nonetheless declined further The monetary policies of other advanced-economy central banks remained quite accommodative, and some signs of progress on central banks' inflation mandates were evident Late in the intermeeting period, market participants came to interpret US monetary policy communications as implying high odds of a firming of monetary policy at this meeting, and changes in market prices suggested a slightly steeper path for the federal funds rate over the next few years than was previously anticipated Survey results indicated that market participants saw a change in the FOMC's policy of reinvesting principal payments on its securities holdings as most likely to be announced in late 2017 or the first half of 2018 Most market participants anticipated that, once a change to reinvestment policy was announced, reinvestments would most likely be phased out rather than stopped all at once
