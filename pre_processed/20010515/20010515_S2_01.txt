The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, after a period of slow growth associated in part with an inventory correction, the economic expansion would gradually regain strength over the next two years and move back toward a rate near the staff's current estimate of the growth of the economy's potential output. The period of subpar expansion was expected to foster an easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation. Despite the substantial easing in the stance of monetary policy, the forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to an extent by some of the developments in financial markets-in particular, the decline in household net worth associated with the earlier downturn in equity prices, the continuation of relatively stringent terms and conditions on some types of loans by financial institutions, and the appreciation of the dollar. Partly as a result of the decline in household wealth, growth of consumer spending was expected to remain relatively low for some time, and housing demand would increase only a little from its recent level. However, business fixed investment, notably outlays for equipment and software, would resume relatively good growth after a period of adjustment of capital stocks to more desirable levels; a projected recovery in the growth of foreign economies was seen as providing increased support for U.S. exports; and fiscal policy was assumed to become more expansionary.
