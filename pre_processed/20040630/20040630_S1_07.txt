Growth in real consumer spending appeared to have slowed somewhat in recent months from its first-quarter pace. Although outlays for motor vehicles in May more than retraced their April decline and purchases of services advanced at an appreciable rate, spending on nondurable goods remained sluggish. Despite higher energy prices, real disposable personal income continued its uptrend in recent months, benefiting from an improved labor market and last year's tax cut. Home prices also continued to rise at a rapid pace, contributing importantly to increases in household wealth. Survey measures of consumer confidence moved up in June from already favorable levels.
