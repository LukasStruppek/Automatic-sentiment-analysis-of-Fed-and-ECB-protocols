Members commented that fiscal policy was continuing to provide appreciable impetus to the economy, in part because of the incentives for business investment associated with the partial-expensing tax legislation. Following the scheduled expiration of that legislation at the end of this year and with more moderate gains in federal spending forecast in the absence of new legislation, the federal budget was expected to become mildly contractionary in 2005, although a marked degree of uncertainty surrounded this outlook. Many state and local governments were increasing their spending more rapidly in response to brightening budget situations.
