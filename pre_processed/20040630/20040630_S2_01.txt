The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would continue to expand at a solid pace through 2005. Monetary policy was expected to support economic activity over the projection period, and fiscal policy was anticipated to remain accommodative through 2004. Moreover, persisting strong gains in structural productivity would likely continue to provide significant impetus to spending. With firms shedding their unusual caution of the past few years, further large additions to payrolls over the next several quarters were anticipated, followed by a gradual moderation in the rate of increase in employment. Strong profits, sustained increases in aggregate demand, and a favorable financing environment were expected to keep business spending on equipment and software on a healthy upward trajectory over the forecast period. The impending expiration of the partial-expensing tax provision was likely to provide an additional boost to capital spending later this year, although the shifting forward of some investment was expected to dampen capital spending in early 2005. In addition, inventory investment was forecast to increase gradually in order to bring changes in stocks closer in line with rising sales. Robust employment growth and the cumulative productivity gains of recent years were expected to contribute to strong advances in real disposable income, sustaining the expansion of consumption spending over the forecast period. Core inflation was projected to fall back later this year from its pace in the first five months and to remain low in 2005, as the transitory effects of higher energy and non-oil import prices waned.
