The U.S. international trade deficit reached a new record in April, reflecting in large part a sharp decline in exports of goods. The fall in goods exports was widespread, with notable decreases in capital goods, industrial supplies, and agricultural products. Exports of services, in contrast, increased in April. Imports of goods edged higher, as a large decline in the value of imported oil was offset by an increase in imports of non-oil products, and imports of services increased. Real GDP in the major foreign industrial countries expanded at a healthy pace in the first quarter. Indicators of economic activity in the second quarter for Canada and the United Kingdom were also favorable, whereas those for the euro area were somewhat mixed. Japan's economy, supported by robust private domestic demand and rising consumer confidence, evidently continued to expand strongly in the second quarter. Mainly as a result of higher energy prices, consumer price inflation moved up a bit in the second quarter in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the euro area, while slight deflation persisted in Japan.
