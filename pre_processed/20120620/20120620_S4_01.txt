 Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that the economy had been expanding moderately However, growth in employment had slowed in recent months, and almost all members saw the unemployment rate as still elevated relative to levels that they viewed as consistent with the Committee's mandate Members generally expected growth to be moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually, with the unemployment rate declining only slowly Most projected somewhat slower growth through next year, and a smaller reduction in unemployment, than they had projected in April Furthermore, strains in global financial markets, which largely stemmed from the sovereign debt and banking situation in Europe, had increased during the intermeeting period and continued to pose significant downside risks to economic activity both here and abroad, making the outlook quite uncertain The possibility that US fiscal policy would be more contractionary than anticipated was also cited as a downside risk Inflation had slowed, mainly reflecting the decline in the prices of crude oil and gasoline in recent months Averaging through its recent fluctuations, inflation appeared to be running near the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective; with longer-term inflation expectations stable, members anticipated that inflation over the medium run would be at or below that rate Some members judged that persistent slack in resource utilization posed downside risks to the outlook for inflation In contrast, one member thought that maintaining the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy well into 2014 would pose upside risks to inflation
