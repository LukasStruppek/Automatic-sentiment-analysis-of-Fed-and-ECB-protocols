The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to point to a substantial strengthening in the economic expansion during the second half of the year. Accommodative financial conditions, recent additional fiscal stimulus, and robust gains in structural productivity were evidently providing significant impetus to business and consumer spending. Inventory levels had been substantially reduced, and the size of business capital stocks apparently had continued to move closer to acceptable levels. As a consequence, improving sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were projected to boost business investment spending over time. Given the substantial ongoing slack in resource utilization, the staff forecast anticipated some slight downward pressure on core consumer price inflation.
