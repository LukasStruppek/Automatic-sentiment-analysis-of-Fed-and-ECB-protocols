M2 contracted moderately in September after growing rapidly in July and August. The reversal appears to have stemmed mainly from a contraction in deposits resulting from reduced mortgage refinancing activity. In addition, the temporary effects of a major power blackout in August had boosted M2 growth in that month, and the subsequent runoff of those deposits likely depressed M2 in September.
