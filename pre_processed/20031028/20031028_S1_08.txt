Real outlays for equipment and software in the third quarter appeared to have advanced at a faster rate than in the second quarter. Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft moved up in September, more than reversing a decline in August. Orders for these goods rose moderately in September after being flat in August. Nominal outlays for construction of privately owned buildings were about unchanged, on net, during the twelve months ending in August. Continued strength in the construction of private institutional structures such as schools, churches, and hospitals was about offset by weakness in other areas of nonresidential construction.
