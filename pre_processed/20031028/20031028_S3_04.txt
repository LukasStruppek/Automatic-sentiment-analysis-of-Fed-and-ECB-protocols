In their comments about the outlook for demand in key sectors of the economy, members continued to view business capital spending as a critical factor in the prospects for the performance of the overall economy. Business expenditures for new equipment and software clearly had turned up since earlier in the year, but anecdotal reports from around the nation continued to suggest that much of this spending was for replacement and upgrading purposes rather than expansion. Such reports also indicated that business contacts, while more confident, remained very cautious, with most firms hesitant to expand their facilities or hire permanent workers until they saw firmer indications that the recent upturn in business activity would be sustained. Some firms reportedly were directing capital investments to foreign markets rather than domestically, apparently largely to take advantage of lower labor costs abroad. Members nonetheless expressed the view that in the context of further anticipated increases in profits and sales, business confidence would continue to improve and induce greater investment and workforce expansions. On the negative side, there were few indications of a possible upturn in commercial construction activity.
