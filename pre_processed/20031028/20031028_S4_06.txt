At this meeting the members continued their earlier discussion of how best to communicate the Committee's general assessment of the outlook for economic activity and inflation. The members recognized that changing circumstances required adaptations in the Committee's communications with the ultimate objective of fostering the best possible public understanding of monetary policy decisions. A number of alternative approaches and specific suggestions were discussed, and in the absence of a consensus at this meeting the members agreed that further study under the guidance of a working group comprised of Committee members was desirable. The working group would develop a limited number of specific proposals for consideration at a later meeting.
