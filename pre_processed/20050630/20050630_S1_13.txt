The decision at the May FOMC meeting to raise the federal funds rate target 25 basis points, to 3 percent, to maintain an assessment that risks to the goals of price stability and sustained growth were balanced, and to retain the "measured pace" language was widely expected in financial markets. The publication of the minutes three weeks later also contained few surprises for investors and elicited little market reaction. Market expectations for the future path of policy ended the period higher in the near term but lower at longer horizons. Nominal Treasury yields followed the shift in policy expectations, with near-term yields higher and longer-term yields modestly lower, on net. Spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds were little changed over the intermeeting period, but spreads on speculative-grade bonds contracted notably. Buoyed by the drop in longer-term interest rates and largely upbeat economic news, major equity indexes rose appreciably over the intermeeting period. The positive economic data also seemed to lift the dollar against major foreign currencies, though the dollar's moves against individual currencies varied widely.
