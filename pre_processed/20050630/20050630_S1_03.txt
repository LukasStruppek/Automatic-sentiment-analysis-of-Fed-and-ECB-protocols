The information received at this meeting suggested that the economy was expanding at a moderate pace in the second quarter. Housing activity remained at a high level, business investment appeared to have improved some after a slowdown of growth in the first quarter, and manufacturing picked up notably in May. Supported by a rebound in motor vehicle purchases, consumer spending appeared on track to post another moderate gain for the quarter. Labor demand continued to expand, and the unemployment rate edged down further in May. Core CPI inflation slowed in April and May, but crude oil prices turned higher again following a decline earlier in the spring.
