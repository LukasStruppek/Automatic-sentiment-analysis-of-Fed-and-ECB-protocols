In considering the statement to be released following this meeting, members concurred that it should note that even with the rise in oil prices, the expansion remained firm and labor markets continued to improve gradually. All also thought that the statement should note the continued pressures on inflation, while mentioning that long-term inflation expectations remained well contained. With policy still seen as accommodative, members agreed that the statement should retain an assessment that the risks to both sustainable economic growth and price stability were balanced, conditional on appropriate policy action. Members also agreed that the statement language indicating that "policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured" correctly characterized the outlook for policy for now. The members concurred that at this stage in the expansion, with margins of slack resources narrowing and inflation somewhat higher, the Committee needed to be particularly alert to signs of a further increase in inflation. Such an increase could be particularly problematic because it might impart upward momentum to inflation expectations that would be costly to reverse. In any case, additional tightening would probably be necessary, but views differed on the amount of tightening that would likely be required to keep inflation contained and bring output in line with potential. However, members agreed that there was no need to make such an assessment at this time, and that the appropriate pace and degree of cumulative policy adjustment would depend on economic developments going forward. With the forward-looking language in the statement clearly conditioned on the outlook, it was not seen as limiting the Committee's flexibility in responding to such developments.
