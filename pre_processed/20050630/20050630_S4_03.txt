While agreeing that inflation developments had to be watched carefully, other meeting participants emphasized that recent core inflation data had been relatively restrained, and anecdotal reports suggested that pricing power at many firms remained quite limited. Moreover, readings from futures markets suggested that oil prices would likely flatten out, so their effect on inflation should gradually ebb. Similarly, prices of other commodities and imports, which had surged for a time, were now moderating. Survey and market measures of long-term inflation expectations did not suggest that the earlier higher inflation readings were going to persist. Finally, while the degree of slack in labor markets was uncertain, total labor compensation had probably been boosted temporarily around the turn of the year by special factors, and the recent behavior of a range of other indicators of labor costs appeared consistent with some remaining slack that would likely tend to restrain inflation pressures. Moreover, anecdotal reports of labor market conditions continued to point to shortages of labor only for certain, mostly skilled, occupations.
