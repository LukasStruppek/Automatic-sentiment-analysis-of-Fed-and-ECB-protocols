Spending on equipment and software registered a solid increase in the first quarter, and the available data suggested that second-quarter spending was continuing at a slightly faster pace. Shipments of nondefense capital goods posted sizable increases in recent months, although gains in orders were more uneven. Broadly speaking, the fundamentals continued to support business investment, with the user cost of capital still low and corporate balance sheets healthy. Outlays for construction of nonresidential structures appeared to have picked up some, but the level of such investment remained subdued. And although spending on commercial structures had moved up in recent months, outlays for office buildings were still at depressed levels, and expenditures on manufacturing and other facilities were lackluster.
