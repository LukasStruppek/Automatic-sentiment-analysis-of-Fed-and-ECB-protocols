Several meeting participants expressed some concern about domestic and global imbalances. Large federal budget deficits were expected to persist despite an increase in tax receipts in recent months. These deficits were contributing to a low level of national saving that would, if not corrected over time, ultimately constrain investment and overall economic growth. Moreover, U.S. trade deficits were expected to remain large going forward, reflecting both the low level of U.S. saving and relatively slow growth in some of our trading partners. Uncertainties regarding the nature and timing of the potential correction of these imbalances complicated the assessment of the intermediate-term prospects for the U.S. economy.
