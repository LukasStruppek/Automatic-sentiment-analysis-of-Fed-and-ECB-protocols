In preparation for the Federal Reserve's semiannual report to the Congress on monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for 2005 and 2006. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP were concentrated in the upper part of a 3 to 3-3/4 percent range for 2005, and the forecasts for 2006 were concentrated at the lower end of a range of 3-1/4 to 3-3/4 percent. These rates of growth were associated with a civilian unemployment rate of 5 to 5-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and a rate of 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006. Forecasts of the rate of inflation, as measured by the core PCE price index, were mainly near the middle of a 1-1/2 to 2-1/4 percent range this year and somewhat below the middle of a range of 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 percent next year.
