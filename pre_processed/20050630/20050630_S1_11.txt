Consumer prices were about unchanged in May after posting large increases in the previous few months. Consumer energy prices, in particular, reversed part of their earlier run-up. Excluding food and energy, inflation appeared to have moderated slightly from its pace in the early part of the year. Despite this moderation, measures of core consumer price inflation over the past year were somewhat above those for the comparable period a year ago. The producer price index rose sharply in April, but dropped back again in May, driven largely by a swing in the food and energy components. According to recent surveys, both near-term and longer-term inflation expectations had changed little over the past two months, and market measures of inflation compensation had moved lower. With regard to labor costs, growth in hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector in the first quarter was estimated to have slowed some after advancing notably in the fourth quarter; the first quarter increase was broadly similar to those posted during the middle of last year.
