In their discussion of developments in asset markets, the participants' comments focused on two related issues: the low level of long-term interest rates and the continued run-up in home prices. Despite substantial cumulative policy tightening over the past year, long-term Treasury yields had moved considerably lower, implying a significant flattening of the yield curve (measured as the spread between long-term and short-term Treasury yields). Lower compensation for inflation accounted for a portion of the decline in longer-term nominal yields, but a larger portion reflected reductions in real yields. Participants cited a variety of factors as possibly contributing to the unusual behavior of long-term rates over this period. For one, investors might have marked down the level of real interest rates seen as likely to be necessary to contain inflation and keep output in line with potential--perhaps reflecting weak investment demand abroad relative to saving--or even might have come to expect a stretch of sub-par U.S. growth. However, anticipation of slow growth seemed inconsistent with higher stock prices and thin risk spreads in corporate debt markets. The behavior of long-term interest rates could also reflect reduced uncertainty on the part of investors about the economic outlook -- as seen in low readings of implied volatility in bond and equity markets. Finally, demands for longer-term U.S. securities by both domestic and foreign investors might have been boosted by special factors. Confidence about the economic outlook and low market interest rates--along with possibly outsized expectations of capital gains in some markets--could also help to account for the high level of home prices the Committee had discussed on the first day of the meeting. It was agreed that considerable uncertainty attended the outlook for both long-term interest rates and home prices.
