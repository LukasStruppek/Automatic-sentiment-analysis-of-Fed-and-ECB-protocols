In the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, the economy was seen as likely to expand this year and next at a rate just above its potential. The effects of reduced monetary and fiscal policy stimulus were expected to be counterbalanced by continued low long-term interest rates and an abatement of energy-related headwinds. Household spending was expected to firm going forward as real income posts solid gains attributable in part to the ongoing improvement in the labor market. Business investment was projected to benefit from the combination of favorable prospects for sales, supportive financial markets, and the ongoing need to replace or upgrade aging equipment and software. A slightly larger portion of domestic demand was expected to be supplied by imports over the forecast period. The forecast for consumer price inflation was revised up, with inflation seen as somewhat higher this year than in 2004, reflecting in part higher import prices and the direct and indirect effects of higher energy prices, and only edging lower next year as these price pressures wane.
