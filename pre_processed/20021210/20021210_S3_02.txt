The improvement of overall conditions in financial markets had provided an additional positive element to the economic outlook. The improvement began before the November meeting and had been given added impetus by the Committee's sizable easing at that meeting. The general calming of financial markets was reflected in some decline in risk spreads from very high levels and sizable new issuance in private bond markets; in equity markets, issuance had edged up and stock prices, though recently declining somewhat, were still well above the lows of early October. Some of this improvement in financial markets seemed to be related to apparently lessening concerns about new revelations of corporate governance issues as a result of the passage of time without further significant incidents. In addition, many business firms had continued to enhance their prospects for rising profits through productivity improvements and debt restructurings that were strengthening their balance sheets and liquidity. Concurrently, indicators of credit quality in the household sector appeared to have remained essentially stable. Reference also was made to the continued robust growth in reserve and money measures.
