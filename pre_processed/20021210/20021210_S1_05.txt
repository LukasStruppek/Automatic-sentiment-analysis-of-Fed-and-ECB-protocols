Industrial production dropped sharply further in October, with roughly half of the decline related to a slowdown in motor vehicle assemblies and the manufacture of related parts. The rest of the manufacturing sector also was weak on balance, with output down in almost all market groups. The high-tech sector was an exception, although the rise in output of computers and semiconductors in October was smaller than earlier in the year and the production of communications equipment continued to fall. Consistent with the poor performance of industrial production, capacity utilization in manufacturing fell again in October and remained substantially below its long-run average.
