The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity would be relatively muted over the near term. Faced with heightened geopolitical tensions as well as persisting concerns about the near-term course of economic activity and corporate earnings, businesses and households were likely to hold down their spending, and the outlook for continued sluggish economic growth among most major trading partners would damp U.S. exports. However, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time, and the considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place, continuing strong gains in structural productivity, and anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus to spending. Inventory overhangs had been largely eliminated and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a slowly improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to provide a gradual boost to business investment spending. The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster a slight moderation in core price inflation.
