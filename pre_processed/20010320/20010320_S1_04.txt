The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity continued to expand very slowly in the first quarter. Growth of final spending apparently picked up slightly, with consumer expenditures recording another moderate gain, business purchases of equipment and software increasing sluggishly after a fourth-quarter decline, and homebuilding remaining relatively firm. However, inventory overhangs were still apparent in some industries, and manufacturing production was cut sharply further. Overall employment gains were relatively well maintained, and labor markets were still tight though showing signs of softening. Price inflation had picked up a little but, abstracting from energy, had remained relatively subdued.
