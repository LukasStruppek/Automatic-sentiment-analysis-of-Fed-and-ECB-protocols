Mirroring the statistics for the nation as a whole, business conditions in different parts of the country displayed mixed industry patterns, but members reported that overall business activity currently appeared to be growing at a sluggish pace in most regions, and business contacts were exhibiting a heightened sense of caution, or even concern, in some industries. In their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members indicated that they saw favorable prospects for continued moderate growth in consumer expenditures, though considerable uncertainty surrounded this outlook. Downside risks cited by the members included the substantial declines that had already occurred in measures of consumer confidence and equity wealth, and the possibility that consumer sentiment might be undermined even further by continued volatility and additional declines in the stock market and by rising concerns about job losses amid persistent announcements of layoffs. Members also referred to the retarding effects on consumer expenditures of elevated levels of household debt and high energy costs. Against this background, consumers might well endeavor to boost their savings, and even a fairly small increase in what currently was a quite low saving rate would have large damping effects on aggregate demand that could weaken, if not abort, the expansion. To date, however, overall consumer spending had remained relatively strong and seemingly at odds with measures of consumer confidence and reduced equity wealth. How this divergence might eventually be resolved was a significant source of uncertainty and downside risk. On balance, while there were reasons to be concerned about the outlook for consumer spending, members believed that recent spending trends and the outlook for further growth in employment and incomes pointed to continued expansion in this key sector of the economy, though likely at a relatively sluggish pace.
