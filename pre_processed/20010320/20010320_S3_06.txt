Members commented on the downside risks to U.S. exports and the U.S. expansion from what appeared to be softening economic conditions in a number of important foreign economies. In some countries, the risks were exacerbated by the apparent inability or unwillingness of government officials to address underlying structural problems in their economies and financial systems. Members noted anecdotal reports of weakening business conditions in a number of Asian and South American nations. The potential impact on exports of less vigor in the global economy would be augmented, of course, by the strength of the dollar in foreign exchange markets.
