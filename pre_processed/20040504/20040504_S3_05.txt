Fiscal policy was viewed as likely to buoy the expansion of economic activity through 2004. Real federal expenditures had jumped in the first quarter and were expected to rise further over the balance of the year. Next year, fiscal impetus was likely to diminish, largely owing to the expiration of the tax provision permitting partial expensing of certain capital outlays. Assessing the prospects for fiscal policy, however, was complicated by a lack of legislative progress to date in passing federal appropriations bills. Regarding the longer-term federal budgetary outlook, an apparent breakdown in fiscal discipline was seen as an ongoing concern. However, some progress was noted in reducing budgetary imbalances at the state and local levels.
