At its meeting on March 16, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 percent. In its announcement of this decision, the Committee indicated that the upside and downside risks to sustainable growth were roughly equal and that the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation had declined further so that it was almost equal to that of a rise. The Committee also noted in March that although output had continued to expand at a solid pace, new hiring had lagged, and increases in core consumer prices were muted and expected to remain low. As a result, the Committee determined that it could remain patient in removing its policy accommodation.
