Despite a weather-related decline in output at utilities during March, the pace of industrial production quickened during the first quarter, and the gains were widespread across industry and market groups. The high-tech sector accounted for a significant part of the increase, as output of computers and semiconductors rose rapidly. Production of other business equipment also increased markedly, and indexes for business and construction supplies were up notably. Motor vehicle assemblies were slightly higher for the first quarter as a whole, although they slowed in March. Manufacturing capacity utilization rose for the second consecutive quarter, but to a rate well below its long-run average. Available weekly physical product data for April were up slightly.
