Real nonfarm inventories increased a bit more in the first quarter than they had in the fourth quarter. Motor vehicle inventories at the retail and wholesale levels accounted for the entire increase, while non-auto inventories ran off slightly. In particular, manufacturers continued to reduce their stocks, though at a slower pace than last year. Inventory accumulation lagged growth in sales and shipments, and the inventory-sales ratio edged down further.
