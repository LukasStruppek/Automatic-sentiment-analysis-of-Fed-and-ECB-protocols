Growth of consumer spending appeared to moderate after posting sizable gains around the turn of the year. Excluding motor vehicles, real outlays rose temperately in March, boosted by the continued rise in spending on services. Spending on goods excluding motor vehicles posted a second-straight monthly decline after robust gains over the previous four months. Sales of light vehicles held steady in March and picked up a bit in April, bringing the average pace for the year well above that of the fourth quarter but about even with the rate of last year. Although continued improvements in the labor market had been generating considerable gains in nominal wage and salary income, rising gasoline prices held down the increase in real disposable personal income in March and were expected to damp it in April as well. Ongoing increases in home prices and additional gains in the stock market, however, further boosted household wealth during the first quarter. Measures of consumer confidence remained consistent with moderate increases in consumer spending.
