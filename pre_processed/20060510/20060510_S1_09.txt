Real outlays for equipment and software surged in the first quarter after a relatively subdued performance in the fourth quarter of last year. Much of the growth reflected a sharp jump in business purchases of transportation equipment, such as airplanes and motor vehicles. Spending on high-tech equipment and software also improved as exceptionally strong growth in expenditures for communications equipment more than compensated for fairly soft spending on computers and peripherals and on software. Conditions in the nonresidential construction sector improved noticeably. Although spending on nonresidential building construction remained well short of the robust levels seen in late 2000, growth of expenditures in this sector was at its fastest pace in the first quarter in nearly six years. Outlays on drilling and mining structures continued to climb in the first quarter, and available data pointed to ongoing growth.
