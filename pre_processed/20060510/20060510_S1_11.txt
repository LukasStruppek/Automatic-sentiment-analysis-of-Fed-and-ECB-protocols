The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in February as a sharp decrease in imports more than offset a modest fall in exports. The declines in both categories were generally widespread across sectors with the exception of oil imports, which were flat, and imported services, which rose. Incoming data for foreign industrial economies were generally favorable and pointed to continued expansion. Available data showed continued growth in GDP in the United Kingdom in the first quarter, continuing strong domestic demand in Canada through February, ongoing recovery in Japan, and a first-quarter rebound in euro-area economic performance.
