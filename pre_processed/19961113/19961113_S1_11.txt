[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed somewhat in August from a high rate in July; however, for the two months combined, the deficit was considerably wider than its average rate for the second quarter. Exports declined appreciably over the July-August period, with most of the decrease occurring in nonmonetary gold and aircraft. Imports rose only marginally on balance over the two months. The limited available information suggested that, on average, economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries expanded moderately in the third quarter. ']
