[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the growth of economic activity slowed substantially in the third quarter, and the limited information available for the period since then indicated continued moderate expansion. A marked softening in the growth of consumer expenditures accounted for much of the slowing in the third quarter, but slight weakening in housing demand, net exports, and federal purchases of goods and services also exerted retarding effects. On the other hand, a sizable increase in inventory investment, greater strength in business demand for durable equipment, and an upturn in spending on nonresidential construction helped foster moderate further economic growth in the third quarter. Employment posted sizable increases over the third quarter and rose substantially further in October, but on balance the gains were somewhat below those recorded earlier in the year. Industrial production had weakened somewhat recently. Consumer price inflation had picked up this year because of larger increases in food and energy prices. Increases in labor compensation, though moderating in the third quarter, also had been somewhat larger this year. ']
