[' The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in economic activity slowed substantially in the third quarter, and the limited available information indicates continued moderate expansion more recently. Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably on balance over September and October. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 5.2 percent in October. Industrial production, which continued to rise in the third quarter, appears to have declined in October owing in important measure to work stoppages in the motor vehicles industry. Total retail sales turned up in September after slumping earlier in the summer. Housing starts fell in September from the exceptionally high level registered in August. Outlays for business equipment were strong in the third quarter and new orders continued to trend upward; business spending on nonresidential structures posted a moderate advance. Inventory investment was substantial in the third quarter, but inventory-sales ratios remained relatively low. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened considerably in July-August from its average rate in the second quarter. Increases in labor compensation, though moderating in the third quarter, have trended up this year; consumer price inflation also has picked up this year, owing to larger increases in food and energy prices.
