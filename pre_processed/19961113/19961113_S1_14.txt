[' With incoming information continuing to suggest moderate economic growth and subdued price inflation, open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and the federal funds rate generally remained close to the level expected with an unchanged policy stance. Market participants had anticipated some tightening of monetary policy at the September 24 meeting, and the announcement of an unchanged policy led to an immediate decline in interest rates, with the larger decreases occurring at the shorter end of the yield curve. Interest rates, especially those at intermediate and longer maturities, dropped further over the remainder of the period in response to information indicating that price and labor cost pressures were lower than market participants had expected. Equity markets responded to the declines in interest rates as well as to favorable earnings reports, and most major indexes reached record highs. ']
