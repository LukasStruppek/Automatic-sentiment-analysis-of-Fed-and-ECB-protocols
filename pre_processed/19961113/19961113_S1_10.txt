[' The pace of inventory investment picked up markedly after midyear, but inventory-sales ratios nonetheless remained relatively low. In manufacturing, inventories rose moderately in the third quarter, more than offsetting a small rundown in stocks in the previous quarter; stock-shipments ratios for most industries remained near the low end of their recent ranges. In the wholesale sector, inventories declined sharply in September after having edged down in the previous two months, and the aggregate inventory-sales ratio for the sector fell to the low end of its range over recent years. At the retail level, substantial inventory accumulation occurred over the July-August period (latest data). Although stock-sales ratios rose slightly, inventories remained relatively well aligned with sales. ']
