[' Consumer price inflation had picked up on balance this year as a result of sizable increases in food and energy prices. Over August and September, however, increases in food prices were offset by a net decline in energy prices, and overall consumer prices rose more moderately. For the twelve months ended in September, the advance in consumer prices of items other than food and energy was a little smaller than it had been over the previous twelve months. At the producer level, price inflation also was moderate over August and September despite appreciable increases in the prices of food and energy items; producer prices of items other than food and energy rose considerably less over the twelve months ended in September than they had over the previous twelve months. Growth in the employment cost index for private industry workers slowed considerably in the third quarter after having trended up over the first two quarters of the year; however, this measure of labor compensation was up slightly over the twelve months ended in September compared with the previous twelve months. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers were unchanged in October, but the twelve-month rise in this index through October was a bit larger than the increase over the previous twelve months.
