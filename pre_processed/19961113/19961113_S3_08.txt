[' Despite the recent encouraging reports on labor compensation and prices, the members agreed that the risks of rising inflation could not be dismissed and several continued to view slightly higher inflation as a likely if not inevitable prospect. Much would depend, of course, on the strength of the economic expansion and the associated degree of pressure on resources, notably in labor markets which appeared to have comparatively little slack in relation to other producer resources. It was suggested in this regard that restrained increases in labor compensation in comparison with historical experience probably were a transitory phenomenon, though one could not predict when a more normal relationship would re-emerge. A related concern was whether the tightness in labor markets would ease sufficiently and quickly enough to prevent inflation pressures from escalating significantly. Some members mentioned a number of favorable factors in the outlook for inflation that tended to attenuate such concerns, such as reduced pressures on food prices as a result of better-than-expected harvests and improved supply conditions in markets for energy. Relatively restrained monetary growth in recent months also was cited as a development consistent with subdued inflationary pressures. Moreover, the view was advanced that recent developments in bond markets could be read as suggesting some decrease in inflationary expectations. On balance, while the members expressed varying degrees of concern that tight labor markets and attendant increases in wages might at some point lead to rising price inflation, they agreed that there was little or no evidence of such a development at this point and the outlook was far from certain.
