[' In their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members said that they anticipated a pickup in consumer spending from its much reduced rate of growth in the third quarter. While the factors relating to the prospects for consumer expenditures did not all point toward greater strength, members tended to focus on those favoring an upturn. These included persisting growth in employment and incomes and clearly upbeat consumer sentiment as evidenced by recent surveys and anecdotal reports. Financial factors also seemed likely on balance to accommodate continuing growth in consumer spending, in particular the marked increases that had occurred in the value of stock holdings and a still-ample availability of credit to most households. Supporting evidence included anecdotal reports from retailers in a numbers of areas who were experiencing sizable gains in sales and seemed optimistic about the outlook for the upcoming holiday season. Among the developments that would tend to limit growth in consumer spending, members emphasized the level of consumer indebtedness which had strained the liquidity of many households. The growth of consumer credit was now exhibiting a moderating trend, possibly pointing to restrained spending by many households because of already heavy debt service burdens and generally tightening credit standards for consumer loans. Other negative factors cited in the outlook for consumer expenditures were the possibility of a correction in the stock market and the probable satisfaction of much of the earlier pent-up demand for consumer durables. In balancing these conflicting influences, the members generally concluded that a pickup in the growth of consumer spending to a moderate pace was a likely prospect for this critical sector of the economy.
