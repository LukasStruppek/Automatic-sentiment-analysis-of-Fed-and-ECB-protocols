[" The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would continue at a rate close to, or perhaps a little above, the economy's estimated growth potential. Consumer spending was projected to rebound in the current quarter and subsequently to expand at a moderate pace in line with the projected increase in disposable income; the favorable effect on household wealth of the rise that had occurred in stock prices and the ample availability of credit for most borrowers were expected to balance continuing consumer concerns about the adequacy of their savings and the restraining effect of high household debt burdens. Homebuilding was forecast to decline slightly further in response to the previous backup in residential mortgage rates but to stabilize at a relatively high level in the context of continued income growth and a generally favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership. Business spending on equipment and structures was projected to grow less rapidly in light of the anticipated moderate growth of sales and profits. On balance, the external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period. A slight degree of fiscal restraint was anticipated over the forecast horizon. Continued pressure on resources, especially in labor markets, pointed to a likely underlying tendency toward higher inflation over the projection period; however, it was expected that improved supply conditions in food and energy markets, as well as planned technical changes, would damp increases in the consumer price index relative to the elevated 1996 rate.
