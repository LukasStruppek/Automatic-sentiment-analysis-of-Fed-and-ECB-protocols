[" In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies depreciated slightly on balance over the intermeeting period.

The dollar declined against the pound sterling in response to the release of favorable data on the U.K. economy as well as an unexpected increase in the Bank of England's minimum lending rate. "]
