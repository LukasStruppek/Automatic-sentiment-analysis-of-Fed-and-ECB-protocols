[' In the Committees discussion, members commented that most recent developments bearing on the outlook for economic growth and inflation had been favorable. The information on economic activity since the September meeting had confirmed earlier indications of appreciable slowing in the expansion to a sustainable pace close to the economys potential. The outlook remained subject, as usual, to considerable uncertainty, but many of the members observed that underlying trends in key sectors of the economy along with generally supportive financial conditions seemed consistent with further moderate economic expansion. In this regard, several focused on what they saw as the promising prospects for a rebound in the growth of consumer expenditures following weak expansion in the third quarter; the pickup would help sustain moderate economic growth over the nearer term despite some anticipated retrenchment in inventory accumulation. With respect to the outlook for inflation, members emphasized that despite widespread indications of tight labor markets, the increase in wages had been muted and somewhat less than anticipated, and there was no broad evidence of rising price inflation. Indeed, many major measures of inflation had exhibited a slight downtrend since 1993. Looking ahead, views differed to some extent regarding the most likely course for inflation. Several members indicated that, while recent developments were encouraging, they continued to see the risks as tilted toward some rise, even assuming that the expansion settled into a pattern of growth near the economys potential as they anticipated and resource utilization remained near current levels; other members felt that the risks surrounding the forecasts for both economic growth and price inflation had become more evenly balanced, but more evidence was needed before a firm judgment could be reached.
