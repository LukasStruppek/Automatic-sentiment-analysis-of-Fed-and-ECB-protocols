The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is continuing to expand moderately. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased more slowly in March and April after sharp advances earlier in the year; its average growth thus far this year has been above that in the second half of 1989, in part because of the hiring of temporary workers for the census. In April, the civilian unemployment rate moved up to 5.4 percent. Industrial production declined in April, reflecting what appears to be a temporary cutback in the manufacture of motor vehicles. Consumer spending has been sluggish on balance in recent months; outlays for goods have been weak while expenditures for services have remained strong. Business spending for equipment has been rising, but construction activity, both residential and nonresidential, appears to have weakened after a temporary boost early in the year. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed somewhat in January and February from its average rate in the fourth quarter. Consumer prices continued to rise at a faster pace in March than in 1989; producer prices were down somewhat further in April, reflecting additional unwinding of the earlier surge in prices of food and energy. The latest data on employment costs suggest some deterioration in underlying trends.
