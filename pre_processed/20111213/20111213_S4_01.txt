 Members viewed the information on US economic activity received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that the economy was expanding moderately While overall labor market conditions had improved some in recent months, the unemployment rate remained elevated relative to levels that the Committee anticipated would prevail in the longer run Inflation had moderated, and longer-term inflation expectations remained stable However, available indicators pointed to some slowing in the pace of economic growth in Europe and in some emerging market economies Members continued to expect a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters, with the unemployment rate declining only gradually toward levels consistent with the Committee's dual mandate Strains in global financial markets continued to pose significant downside risks to economic activity Members also anticipated that inflation would settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the dual mandate
