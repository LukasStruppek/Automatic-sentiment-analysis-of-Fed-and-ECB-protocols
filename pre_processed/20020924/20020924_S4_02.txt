All the members agreed that the risks to the economy remained tilted toward weakness and that such an assessment needed to be incorporated in the statement to be released shortly after today's meeting. The members also accepted a proposal to add a reference in the statement regarding what they viewed as recently heightened geopolitical risks that appeared to constitute a major source of the uncertainty currently prevailing in the economy. The addition was not intended to signal that any particular policy response would be forthcoming in the event of a crisis. Rather, consistent with its usual practice, the Committee would assess the implications of any such development for the domestic economy before deciding on an action. Indeed, if the geopolitical uncertainties were to ease significantly along with what already were apparently diminishing concerns about corporate governance issues, the resulting improvement in business and consumer sentiment could generate a more robust economic expansion.
