The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed appreciably in July after two quarters of large increases. The smaller deficit in July reflected continued strong expansion of the value of exports coupled with a decrease in the value of imports. The step-up in goods exports occurred mostly in motor vehicles and aircraft, while the gain in exports of services was spread across travel and other private services. The decline in imports was concentrated in consumer and capital goods, royalties, and license fees. The very limited available information on economic activity abroad in the third quarter suggested continued sluggish expansion in the euro area and Japan, moderate growth in the United Kingdom, further brisk recovery in Canada, and ongoing recovery in emerging Asia. Conditions in South America remained fragile: Economic activity was still very weak in Argentina and Venezuela, and the Brazilian economy had been adversely affected by the turbulence in financial markets, though those markets had stabilized recently. By contrast, Mexico experienced brisk growth in the second quarter.
