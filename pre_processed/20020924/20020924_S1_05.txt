Industrial production declined in August, largely offsetting July's rise. Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing output was unchanged in both July and August after sizable advances in the first half of the year. Production in the high-tech sector jumped in August, the manufacture of aircraft and parts fell further, and output in the remainder of the industrial sector was mixed. Capacity utilization in manufacturing changed little in August and was substantially below its long-run average.
