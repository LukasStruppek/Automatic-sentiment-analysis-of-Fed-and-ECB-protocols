In their review of developments in and prospects for key sectors of the economy, members commented that household spending had continued to be well maintained. Buttressed by exceptional strength in sales of motor vehicles, consumer spending had displayed solid growth during the summer months. While survey indicators of consumer confidence had declined this year, the high levels of consumer spending on homes, motor vehicles, and other big-ticket items were, in the view of at least some members, perhaps a better gauge of consumer confidence. The value of homes had continued to rise in most areas, and unusually low interest rates were inducing people to refinance mortgages and in the process to extract and spend some of the embedded equity gains. Increasing home equity values probably were also providing some counterweight to the impact on consumer spending of the negative wealth effects associated with the declines in stock market prices since the spring of 2000. Other positive factors cited as helping to undergird the persisting strength in consumer spending included reductions in federal income tax rates; the availability of financing for consumer durable goods at relatively attractive interest rates, including zero interest rates for selected motor vehicles; and the cumulative effects of productivity gains on current and expected real consumer incomes. Looking ahead, sales of motor vehicles likely would moderate to some extent over coming months from their currently unsustainable levels, and some members referred to indications of slower growth in retail sales in late summer and somewhat downbeat forecasts for coming months reported by a number of retailer contacts. Moreover, the absence of significant growth in employment, should it persist, could at some point have significant adverse repercussions on consumer spending. On balance, consumer spending was seen as likely to remain a positive but possibly a more limited source of support for the expansion over the next several quarters.
