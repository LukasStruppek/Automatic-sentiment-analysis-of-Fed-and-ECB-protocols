In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all but two of the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. In the view of all the members, current forecasts clearly were subject to the risk that economic growth would not be sufficient to reduce excess capacity in labor and capital markets. However, the members who favored a steady policy course noted that the recent data on household and business spending had been a bit stronger than expected and that a number of factors pointed to solid growth over time. In these circumstances, they believed that in the context of prevailing uncertainties more evidence of subpar expansion was desirable before policy was eased further. It was noted in this regard that the information that would become available over the next several weeks should provide an improved basis for assessing the recent anecdotal reports from around the nation that pointed to a possibly slowing expansion. Several members indicated that if compelling evidence of a weak economy were to materialize they would be prepared to ease promptly. Two members preferred an immediate easing action because they were persuaded by what they viewed as already strong evidence of a persisting unsatisfactory, and perhaps weakening, economic performance. While the current stance of policy was already accommodative, they felt that greater stimulus was now called for to foster an acceptable pace of economic expansion.
