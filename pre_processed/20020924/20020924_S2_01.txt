The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, in light of weaker-than-expected incoming economic data, the expansion of economic activity would pick up more gradually but would still reach a relatively brisk pace late next year. The considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place, continuing gains in structural productivity, and improving business confidence would provide significant impetus for spending. Inventory overhangs appeared to have been largely eliminated, and business capital stocks appeared to have moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a gradually improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to boost business investment spending. However, a less robust pickup in final sales was now expected over the forecast period, which would put somewhat less pressure on resource margins than had been anticipated previously, and the level of activity would remain below that of the economyâ€™s potential for a longer time. The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation.
