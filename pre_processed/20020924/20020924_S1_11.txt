Despite a slight pickup in consumer price inflation in August, the increase in consumer prices (measured by either the consumer price index or the chain-indexed personal consumption expenditure index) for the year ending in August was considerably smaller than that for the previous twelve-month period. Much of the drop in inflation reflected developments in the food and energy sectors, but core inflation also declined noticeably. Producer prices for core finished goods likewise signaled a drop in inflation over the last year. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers decelerated sharply over the twelve months ended in August, reflecting the effects of both the rise in unemployment and the drop in consumer price inflation.
