M2 growth remained elevated in August, though somewhat below July's rapid pace. Much of the strength of the aggregate's liquid components likely was associated with the continuing historically low opportunity costs of holding such deposits, the recent surge in mortgage refinancing activity, and the safe haven provided from volatile equity prices. Borrowing by domestic nonfinancial businesses remained weak, likely reflecting reduced requirements for funds to finance capital spending projects and perhaps the improved tone in the corporate bond market and a modest increase in the issuance of corporate debt.
