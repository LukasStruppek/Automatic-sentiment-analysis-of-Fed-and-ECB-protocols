At its meeting on August 13, 2002, the Committee retained a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the intended level of the federal funds rate at 1-3/4 percent, but it shifted from a statement of a neutral balance of risks to one that was tilted toward economic weakness in the foreseeable future. Market participants read the tilt and the wording of the announcement as indicating that economic activity in the coming months likely would be weaker than had been expected, and some short-term interest rates eased slightly while broad indexes of equity prices moved lower. The following dayâ€™s deadline for the recertification of corporate financial statements passed uneventfully and equity markets rallied. Subsequently, however, a weaker tone to incoming data on production and employment, a gloomier outlook for business profits, and heightening tensions over Iraq seemed to lead investors to revise down their outlook for the economy. Over the intermeeting period, intermediate- and longer-term Treasury security yields and broad equity indexes fell considerably on balance.
