Sharp declines in energy prices pulled down overall consumer prices in April and May, but core consumer prices edged up. On a year-over-year basis, however, core consumer price inflation eased noticeably. Core producer price inflation also declined over the year ending in May. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers were flat in April and increased moderately in May. The twelve-month change was somewhat above that for the year earlier.
