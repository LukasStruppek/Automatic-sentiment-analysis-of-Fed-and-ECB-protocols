The ongoing stimulative effects of earlier tax cuts and large increases in defense spending had recently been enhanced by added fiscal stimulus that would provide households with more spendable income in the months immediately ahead than had been anticipated earlier. The expected result would be a relatively prompt and sizable boost to consumer expenditures and, over time, to business spending. Some members expressed reservations, however, about the extent of the near-term effects of tax rate reductions on overall consumer spending, given the likelihood that some portion of the funds transferred to households would be used to reduce personal debts or to add to various savings vehicles. Members also noted that measures taken by many state and local governments to raise taxes and trim spending in order to resolve fiscal crises would offset an uncertain--though in the view of most a small--part of the federal sector stimulus over the period ahead. On balance, given the combined effects of lower tax rates and the outlook for continued high levels of defense spending, the federal sector generally was seen as an important source of stimulus to the economy, both in the near term and over the forecast horizon.
