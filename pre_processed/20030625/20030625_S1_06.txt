Industrial production increased slightly in May after sizable declines in the preceding two months. The manufacturing sector recorded broad-based improvement, though automobile assemblies and the output of communications equipment continued to slide. The effects of strength in the mining sector on the industrial production index were more than offset by a reduction in utility output. Overall capacity utilization remained very low, with manufacturing utilization near a twenty-year low.
