Shipments of nondefense capital goods edged higher in May after posting large increases in earlier months of the year.

Recent data on orders pointed to further brisk growth in coming months. Nonresidential construction activity appeared to have eased recently, with construction-put-in-place slipping in March and April from the elevated pace of the first two months of the year. However, other information suggested that the downturn might be shortlived: Vacancy rates for office space had been declining, prices for commercial real estate had been edging up, and recent data on contracts suggested that building activity would improve in coming months.
