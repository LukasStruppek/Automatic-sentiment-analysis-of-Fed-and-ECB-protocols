[' During the course of the Committees discussion, many of the members commented on the persistence of an impressively benign inflation performance despite widespread indications of very high, and by some measures increasing, levels of capacity use. Indeed, most broad measures of prices pointed to subdued or even declining inflation, and it was difficult to find evidence of rising inflation pressures in "pipeline" price data or the wage structure. The members anticipated that inflation as measured by the consumer price index would decline appreciably over 1997 as a result of favorable developments in the food and especially the energy sectors of the economy and declining import prices associated with the previous appreciation of the dollar. These positive influences would wane over time, however, and consumer prices were likely to rise at a somewhat faster pace in 1998. ']
