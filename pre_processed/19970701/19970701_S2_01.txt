[' The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would expand at a pace somewhat above that of its estimated potential in the second half of the year but would slow to a rate of increase more in line with that of potential in 1998. Growth of consumer spending, supported by high levels of household wealth and further projected gains in employment and income, was expected to be relatively brisk for some time. Business spending on equipment and structures was anticipated to continue outpacing the overall expansion of the economy, though the differential would tend to narrow in association with the gradual diminution of increases in sales and profits that was expected to occur in the context of moderating economic growth. Housing construction was projected to drift lower over the forecast period. The staff anticipated that fiscal policy and the external sector would exert mild restraint on the expansion of economic activity. With labor compensation gradually accelerating in the context of high resource utilization, core consumer price inflation was forecast to drift slightly higher. ']
