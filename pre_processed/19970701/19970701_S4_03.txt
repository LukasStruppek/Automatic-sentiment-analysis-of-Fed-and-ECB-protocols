[' The Committee members were unanimously in favor of retaining the current range of 3 to 7 percent for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt in 1997 and extending that range on a provisional basis to 1998. They took account of a staff projection indicating that growth of the debt aggregate was likely to slow somewhat from its pace in 1995 and 1996, reflecting a small reduction in the expansion of federal government debt. According to the staff projection, growth in the debt measure would be near the midpoint of the existing range over the period through 1998. ']
