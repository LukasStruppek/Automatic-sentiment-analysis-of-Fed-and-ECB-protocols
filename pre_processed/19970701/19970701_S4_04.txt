[' At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to reaffirm the ranges for growth of M2, M3 and total domestic nonfinancial debt that it had established in February for 1997. For the year 1998, the Committee approved provisional ranges for the three aggregates that were unchanged from the 1997 ranges. In keeping with its usual procedure under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the Committee would review its preliminary ranges for 1998 early next year, or sooner if interim conditions warranted, in light of their growth and velocity behavior and ongoing economic and financial developments. Accordingly, the Committee voted to incorporate the following statement regarding the 1997 and 1998 ranges in its domestic policy directive: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Broaddus, Guynn, Kelley, Meyer, Moskow, Parry, Mses. Phillips and Rivlin. ']
