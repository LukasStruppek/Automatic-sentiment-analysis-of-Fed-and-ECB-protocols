[' At its meeting on May 20, 1997, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Because the members saw the potential need for some tightening in monetary policy to counter rising inflationary pressures, perhaps in the relatively near term, the directive included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months. ']
