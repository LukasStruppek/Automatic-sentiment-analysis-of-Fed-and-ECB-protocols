[' Growth of M2 and M3 fluctuated sharply from April to May in association with a swing in household balances related to large tax payments; on balance, both aggregates expanded at a moderate pace over the two months, and available data pointed to further moderate growth in June. For the year through June, M2 expanded at a rate near the upper bound of its range for the year and M3 at a rate somewhat above the upper bound of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand in recent months and is near the middle of its range. ']
