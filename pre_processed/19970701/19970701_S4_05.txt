[' In the Committees discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members favored or could support a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance, and they strongly supported the retention of a bias toward restraint. An unchanged policy seemed appropriate with inflation still quiescent and business activity projected to settle into a pattern of moderate growth broadly consistent with the economys long-run output potential. While the members assessed risks surrounding such a forecast as decidedly tilted to the upside, the slowing of the expansion should keep resource utilization from rising substantially further, and this outlook together with the absence of significant early signs of rising inflationary pressures suggested the desirability of a cautious "wait and see" policy stance at this point. In the current uncertain environment, this would afford the Committee an opportunity to gauge the momentum of the expansion and the related degree of pressure on resources and prices. The risks of waiting appeared to be limited, given that the evidence at hand did not point to a step-up in inflation despite low unemployment and that the current stance of monetary policy did not seem to be overly accommodative, at least on the basis of some measures such as the level of real short-term interest rates. In these circumstances, any tendency for price pressures to mount was likely to emerge only gradually and to be reversible through a relatively limited policy adjustment. Some members commented, however, that in the absence of unanticipated weakness in the economy, some tightening of policy was likely to be needed in the relatively near future, and one expressed the view that a tightening action at this meeting seemed desirable to forestall or limit the risks of intensifying inflationary pressures. However, waiting was an acceptable alternative given the favorable economic news and the persisting uncertainties surrounding the relationship of output to prices. ']
