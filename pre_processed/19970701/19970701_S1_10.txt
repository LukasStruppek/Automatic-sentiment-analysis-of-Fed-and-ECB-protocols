[' Business inventory investment picked up sharply in April from the slow pace in March but, overall, stocks remained at a low level in relation to sales. In manufacturing, much of the increase in stocks occurred in capital goods industries in which production was expanding briskly. In the wholesale sector, a substantial decline in stocks in April more than offset a sizable increase in March, and the aggregate stock-sales ratio for the sector fell further over the March-April period. Retail inventories rose considerably in April, with notable increases in stocks of apparel and general merchandise. In a departure from the general downtrend of recent months, inventory-sales ratios for most types of retail establishments were up appreciably in April. ']
