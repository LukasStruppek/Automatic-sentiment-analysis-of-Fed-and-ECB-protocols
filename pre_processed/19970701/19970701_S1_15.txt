[" In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was up on balance over the intermeeting period; the advance occurred despite a smaller decline on average in long-term interest rates abroad than in the United States. The dollar rose appreciably against the German mark and most other continental European currencies amid growing market concerns that there would be broad participation in the European Monetary Union despite the fact that the major European countries would not be able to comply strictly with the Maastricht fiscal standards and related expectations that the euro would be a weak currency. In contrast, the dollar fell against the Japanese yen and the British pound; the yen moved up as markets focused more closely on recent and prospective increases in Japan's current account surplus, and the pound strengthened in anticipation of further policy tightening by the Bank of England.
