[' Industrial production continued to grow briskly in May. Manufacturing output recorded a substantial gain and mining production rose considerably; however, cooler-than-average weather led to a drop in utility output. Much of the rise in manufacturing reflected a rebound in the production of motor vehicles and parts from strike-depressed levels in April and strength in the output of business equipment, construction supplies, and materials. With output generally keeping pace with the rapid expansion of factory capacity, the rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity remained at a relatively high level. ']
