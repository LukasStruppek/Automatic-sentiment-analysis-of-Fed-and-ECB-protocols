[' The members viewed the prospects for further growth in business fixed investment as another important supportive factor in the outlook for sustained economic expansion. Current indicators pointed to the continuation of very rapid growth in such spending over the near term, but some moderation was likely over the course of coming quarters in conjunction with the projected slowing in the increase of overall demand and the very large buildup in the stock of capital that already had occurred in recent years. Even so, investment spending was likely to be relatively robust over the projection horizon in the context of continuing incentives to hold down production costs in highly competitive markets and to take advantage of falling prices and wider applications for certain types of new equipment, notably computer-related equipment. The ready availability of both debt and equity finance on favorable terms, an upbeat outlook for sales in many industries, and generally high profit levels were other positive factors. The outlook for nonresidential construction activity also seemed to be relatively favorable. Members referred to declining vacancy rates and rising rents for commercial structures in many parts of the country and noted that construction contracts for new office buildings and hotels recently had turned up on a nationwide basis after a pause earlier this year. In sum, the growth in business fixed investment seemed likely to continue to outpace that of overall demand in coming quarters. ']
