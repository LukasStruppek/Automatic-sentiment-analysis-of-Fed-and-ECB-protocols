Payroll employment grew at a good pace in August, and the average increase over the most recent three months was largely on par with the advances made since the fourth quarter of last year. Employment gains were widespread across industries, with the exception of the manufacturing sector, which continued to post small job losses. With employment increasing and the average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers unchanged in August, aggregate hours continued to firm modestly. The unemployment rate dipped to 4.9 percent in August, its lowest level since August 2001. Given the increase in the labor-force participation rate reported for the month, the employment-population ratio rose to its highest level in three years. Initial claims for unemployment insurance jumped in the latest available week, however, as workers in the Gulf Coast region began to file claims.
