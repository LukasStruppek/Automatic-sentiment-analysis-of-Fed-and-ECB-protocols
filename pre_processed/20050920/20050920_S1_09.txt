The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed somewhat in July, as the value of exports of goods and services rose slightly and the value of imports declined. The value of oil imports increased strongly in July but that rise was offset by decreases in imports of services and of non-oil goods. GDP growth in foreign industrial economies picked up, on balance, in the second quarter, but performance across economies was mixed.
