The information reviewed at the March meeting indicated that economic activity had continued to decelerate in recent months. The contraction in homebuilding intensified, consumer spending appeared to be weakening, and survey measures of both consumer and business sentiment were at depressed levels. Industrial production fell in February, and private payroll employment posted a third consecutive monthly decline. After having increased in recent months through January, both headline and core inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) dropped noticeably in February. In early March, however, prices of oil and other commodities rose sharply.
