Labor demand softened markedly in recent months. The decline in private payroll employment that began last December steepened through February. Although employment by firms in the nonbusiness services sector and in state and local governments continued to rise, declines elsewhere were widespread. Losses were greatest in the manufacturing, construction, and retail trade sectors. Aggregate hours of private production or nonsupervisory workers fell slightly in the first two months of the year. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.8 percent in February, but was still up from the 4.5 percent rate of a year earlier. The labor force participation rate declined in February.
