The information reviewed at this meeting has been mixed, but it suggests on balance that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Total nonfarm payroll employment changed little over July and August, and the civilian unemployment rate was 6.8 percent in both months. Employment in manufacturing continued to advance in August, and industrial production posted a further rise after several months of sizable gains. Consumer spending increased considerably on balance in July and August. Recent data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods point to a small increase in real outlays for business equipment, but nonresidential construction has remained weak. Housing starts rose only slightly further in July and August after increasing appreciably on balance since January. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened substantially in July and was considerably above its average rate in the second quarter. Increases in consumer prices have been small in recent months, owing to declines in food and energy prices.
