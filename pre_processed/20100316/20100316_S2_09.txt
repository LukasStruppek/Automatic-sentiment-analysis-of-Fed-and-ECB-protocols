The U.S. international trade deficit widened in December but narrowed slightly in January, ending the period a little larger. Both exports and imports rose sharply in December before pulling back somewhat the following month. For the period as a whole, the rise in exports was broadly based, with notable gains in aircraft and industrial supplies. Oil and other industrial supplies accounted for much of the increase in imports over the two months, while purchases of consumer products declined.
