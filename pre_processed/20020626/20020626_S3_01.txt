In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that there had been little change since the May meeting in the factors bearing on what they viewed as a favorable outlook for a pickup in the expansion. Although financial markets, and perhaps business and household confidence, had been shaken by revelations of accounting irregularities, the economy had continued to expand and the prospects for accelerating aggregate demand remained positive. Some members observed, however, that they had expected to see firmer indications of a strengthening recovery by the time of this meeting. The degree of impetus from decelerating inventory liquidation and growth in final demand had moderated during the spring, and anecdotal and other evidence indicated that the performance of various industries and firms had remained uneven. Looking ahead, the timing and strength of an upturn in the expansion remained subject to considerable uncertainty, but in the absence of major further adverse shocks to confidence the members anticipated that economic activity would accelerate over coming months to a pace in the vicinity of, and perhaps somewhat above, the rate of growth of the economy's potential. In support of this view, members cited the accommodative stance of both fiscal and monetary policy and the continuation of impressive growth in productivity that should buttress household incomes and spending and encourage a pickup in business investment. The strength in productivity also would help to hold down cost and price pressures and, given an economic expansion and resource utilization in line with the members' forecasts, would reinforce the prospect that core price inflation would remain low.
