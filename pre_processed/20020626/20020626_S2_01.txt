The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity would pick up in the last half of the year from the sluggish pace of the second quarter and reach a relatively brisk pace next year. The considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place and the continuing sizable gains in productivity would provide significant impetus for spending, though weakness in equity prices would tend to offset some of that support. With business capital stocks moving closer to desired levels, investment spending would be boosted by a gradually improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software. A more robust contour for final sales over the forecast horizon would lead to somewhat greater pressure on resource margins, despite the expected strong growth of structural productivity, though the level of activity would remain below the economy's potential for some time. The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation.
