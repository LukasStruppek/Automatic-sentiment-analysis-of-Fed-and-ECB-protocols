In preparing for the semiannual monetary policy report to Congress, the Board members and Reserve Bank presidents provided individual projections of the growth of GDP, civilian unemployment, and consumer price inflation for the year 2003. The members agreed that because of the unusual uncertainties that clouded their current forecasts, the latter should be viewed as having extremely wide confidence bands. Their forecasts envisaged a strengthening economic recovery but not one that was likely to induce a material, if any, decline in the unemployment rate over the year ahead. Their forecasts of growth in real GDP for 2003 had a central tendency of 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent and a full range of 3 to 3-3/4 percent, measured as the change between the fourth quarter of 2002 and the fourth quarter of 2003. Their projections of the civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year were all in a range of 5-3/4 to 6 percent. Their forecasts of consumer price inflation for the year, as measured by the PCE chain-type price index, were centered in a range of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent, with a full range of 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 percent.
