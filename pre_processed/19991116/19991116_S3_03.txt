Growth of business spending for equipment and software was expected to moderate in the current quarter, largely in conjunction with what was seen as a temporary slowdown in purchases of computers in the period before the century date change. However, the members saw no significant evidence that the strong uptrend in spending on capital equipment might otherwise be weakening. In contrast to the pattern for business fixed investment, nonfarm inventory investment was projected to rise in the current quarter in connection with a temporary bulge related to the century date change but also to bring lean inventories into better alignment with anticipated sales. Once the perturbations related to the century date change had run their course, inventory growth was expected to return to a more normal pace during 2000.
