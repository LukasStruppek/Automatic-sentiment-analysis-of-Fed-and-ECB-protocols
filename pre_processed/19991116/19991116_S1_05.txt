Industrial production recorded a strong gain in October after having fallen slightly in September as a result of the adverse effects of Hurricane Floyd. Manufacturing and utilities output advanced strongly in October, while mining activity edged up. The increases in manufacturing were widely spread; however, production of transit equipment, particularly aircraft and parts, and farm equipment continued to decline. The utilization of total industrial capacity rebounded in October from the hurricane-related production losses of the previous month but remained somewhat below its long-run average level.
