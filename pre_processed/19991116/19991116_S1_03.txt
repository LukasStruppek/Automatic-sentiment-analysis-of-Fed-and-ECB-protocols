The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity continued to expand briskly. The limited data on aggregate demand that had become available since the summer pointed to some moderation in the growth of consumer spending and of business investment in capital equipment and software. Residential construction appeared to have weakened somewhat. However, industrial production was trending up, job growth was still solid, and the unemployment rate had edged down. Despite tight job markets, labor compensation had been rising more slowly than last year. Inflation remained moderate, though at a pace above that in 1998 because of a sharp rebound in energy prices.
