A large increase in nonfarm payroll employment in October followed a small rise in September; the average gain for the two months was appreciable but somewhat below the pace of earlier in the year. Job growth rebounded strongly in most employment categories, but further small losses were posted in manufacturing and retail trade. The robust expansion in the demand for workers in October led to a small decline in the civilian unemployment rate, to 4.1 percent, a new low for the year.
