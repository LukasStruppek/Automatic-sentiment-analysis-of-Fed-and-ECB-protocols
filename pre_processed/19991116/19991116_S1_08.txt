Business inventory investment in book value terms picked up somewhat in the third quarter, but with sales increasing rapidly, stock-sales ratios generally remained quite low. Manufacturers added slightly to their stocks after two quarters of inventory liquidation. However, the buildup of stocks in the third quarter did not keep pace with the rise in shipments, and the sector's stock-shipments ratio was near the bottom of its range over the preceding twelve months. Wholesalers also added to their inventories in the third quarter, and with stockbuilding keeping pace with sales, the inventory-sales ratio for the sector remained in the lower portion of its range over the past year. In the retail sector, the pace of inventory accumulation slowed noticeably in the third quarter, reflecting a runoff of stocks at auto dealerships. Excluding autos, the rate of retail inventory accumulation changed little from that of the second quarter, and with sales rising rapidly the aggregate inventory-sales ratio fell to its lowest quarterly level since 1980.
