The information reviewed at the June meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity rebounded in the second quarter from its subpar pace in the first quarter. Upswings in net exports and inventory investment were expected to contribute importantly to the rise in real GDP. Consumer spending appeared to have slowed from its rapid pace earlier in the year, while business fixed investment continued to rise at a modest rate. Residential construction remained weak as builders worked further to clear high inventories of unsold homes. Sharp increases in energy prices drove up overall inflation in April and appeared to have done so again in May; core inflation seemed to have remained subdued.
