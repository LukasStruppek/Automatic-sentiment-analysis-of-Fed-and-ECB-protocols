Elevated inventories of unsold new homes continued to weigh on residential construction activity. In May, single-family housing starts declined, and adjusted permit issuance for the single-family sector stepped down further, indicating that builders were intending to slow further the pace of new construction. The monthly readings on sales of new and existing homes through May had fluctuated around levels lower than the average over the second half of 2006. Some, though not all, of this weakening in home sales was likely related to the tightening of lending standards for nonprime borrowers that began in February. Even though the inventory of new homes for sale ticked down in May, the months’ supply in May remained noticeably above its level in late 2006. According to OFHEO’s purchase-only price index for existing homes, house-price appreciation continued to slow in the first quarter.
