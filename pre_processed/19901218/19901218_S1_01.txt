The information reviewed at this meeting suggests appreciable weakening in economic activity. Total nonfarm payroll employment fell sharply further in November, reflecting widespread job losses that were especially pronounced in manufacturing and construc tion; the civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.9 percent. Industrial output declined markedly in October and November, in part because of sizable cutbacks in the production of motor vehicles. Retail sales were weak in real terms in October and November; real disposable income has been reduced not only by a decrease in total hours worked but also by the effects of higher energy prices. Advance indicators of business capital spending point to considerable softening in investment in coming months. Residential construction has declined substantially further in recent months. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened in October from its average rate in the third quarter as non-oil imports rose more sharply than exports. Increases in consumer prices moderated in November largely as a result of a softening in oil prices. The latest data on labor costs suggest some improvement from earlier trends.
