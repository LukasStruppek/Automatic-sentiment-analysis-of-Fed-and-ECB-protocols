Most interest rates have fallen appreciably since the Committee meeting on November 13. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose slightly on balance over the intermeeting period. M2 was about unchanged on balance over October and November after several months of relatively limited expansion, while M3 declined slightly in both months. From the fourth quarter of 1989 through November, expansion of M2 was estimated to be in the lower half of the Committee's range for the year and growth of M3 near the lower end of its range. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have been near the midpoint of its monitoring range.
