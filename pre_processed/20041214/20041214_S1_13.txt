The FOMCÂs decision in November to raise the intended federal funds rate 25 basis points and its attendant public statement were apparently anticipated by the market, so that the reaction was muted. Subsequently, higher-than-expected inflation data, remarks by the Chairman that were viewed as pointing to future rate increases, and the depreciation of the dollar all led market participants to price in a somewhat steeper path for future policy. The upward revision in policy expectations prompted modest increases in shorter-term Treasury coupon security yields. The yield on the ten-year Treasury note, however, was unchanged on net. Yields on both investment-grade and speculative-grade corporate bonds edged lower. The value of the dollar relative to other major currencies declined.
