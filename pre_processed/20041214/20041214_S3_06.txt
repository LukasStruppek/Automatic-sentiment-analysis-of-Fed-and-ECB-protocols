Although the November employment report had been disappointing and recent readings on initial claims for unemployment insurance had risen, participants viewed labor market conditions still as improving gradually. Averaging over recent months, or even the entire year, employment growth had been fast enough to absorb unutilized labor resources over time. Anecdotal information suggested a significant tightening in the market for skilled workers in some industries and regions, although demand for less skilled workers still appeared soft. Recent surveys of hiring plans by businesses were read as signaling future gains in employment. Despite the further improvement in labor markets, a number of participants noted that wage and compensation increases had not picked up materially and generally remained moderate.
