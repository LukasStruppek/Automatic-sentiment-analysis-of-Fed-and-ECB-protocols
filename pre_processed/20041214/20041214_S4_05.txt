The meeting then turned to consideration of releasing FOMC minutes on an accelerated schedule. Meeting participants agreed that an experiment with accelerating the preparation of the minutes that had been conducted since early in the year had been successful in identifying the procedural changes that would be necessary if an accelerated schedule were to be followed going forward. Participants noted that the minutes contained a more complete and nuanced explanation of the reasons for the CommitteeÂs decisions and view of the risks to the outlook than was possible in the post-meeting announcement, and their earlier release would help markets interpret economic developments and predict the course of interest rates. They also would provide the public a more up-to-date context for individual policymakersÂ public remarks. Meeting participants supported the principle of openness and transparency, but debated the possibility that the markets would misinterpret the minutes and that the prospect of early release would lead to either less productive discussions at the meetings or to less comprehensive, and therefore less useful, minutes. A few participants expressed support for trimming the length and forward-looking elements of the post-meeting announcements, should the Committee decide to accelerate release of the minutes. Others, however, preferred not to link the two decisions or viewed the more extensive announcements as useful regardless of the minutesÂ publication schedule.
