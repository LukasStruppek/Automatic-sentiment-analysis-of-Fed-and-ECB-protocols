The clear consensus of the participants at the meeting was to release the minutes on an expedited schedule, and the Committee voted unanimously to begin publishing the minutes of regularly scheduled meetings three weeks after the day of the policy decision. The minutes of any other Committee meetings, such as conference calls, would be handled somewhat differently. In those cases, if a policy action were taken, an announcement of that action would be made as soon as practicably possible. If, however, no action were taken, the fact that the conference call took place would be reflected in the statement following the subsequent regular meeting, and, in any case, the minutes of the call would be released along with the minutes of the subsequent regular meeting.
