With regard to the Committee's announcement to be released after the meeting, members generally agreed that overall economic prospects were similar to those prevailing at the time of the November meeting and that consequently the statement should be altered only to the minor extent required to reflect recent economic developments. They concurred that the statement should note that output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the earlier rise in energy prices, that labor market conditions continue to improve gradually, and that inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well-contained. They also agreed again to characterize the risks to sustainable growth and price stability as balanced. A few members believed that the Committees flexibility would be enhanced by eliminating the forward-looking elements of the Committees statement referring to the pace of removal of policy accommodation. More of the members believed that this language was useful in conveying the Committees sense of the outlook for the economy and the stance of monetary policy and was appropriately conditioned on economic developments. All members agreed that the FOMC statement for this meeting should again indicate that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely to be measured but that the Committee would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain price stability.
