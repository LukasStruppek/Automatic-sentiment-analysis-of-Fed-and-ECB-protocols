Growth in business expenditures for equipment and software had moderated substantially in recent months from very high rates of increase over an extended period. The slowdown reflected a mix of interrelated developments including flagging growth in demand and tightening financial conditions in the form of declining equity prices and stricter credit terms for many business borrowers. The re-evaluation of prospects was most pronounced in the high-tech industries. The profitability of using and producing such software and equipment had been overestimated to a degree, and disappointing sales and a better appreciation of risks had resulted in much slower growth in production of such equipment and sharp deterioration in the equity prices of high-tech companies. At the same time, nonresidential construction activity appeared to have been well maintained in many parts of the country, though there were reports of softening in some regions and of some reductions or delays in planned projects. Against this background, risks of further retrenchment in capital spending persisted, but to date there was no evidence to suggest that the underlying pace of advances in technology and related productivity growth had abated. Over time, further increases in productivity would undergird continuing growth in demand for high-tech equipment. In the nonresidential construction area, members noted that high occupancy rates and high rents were supportive elements in the construction outlook.
