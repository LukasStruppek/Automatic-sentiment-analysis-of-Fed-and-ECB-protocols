Chairman Greenspan indicated that shortly after this meeting the Board of Governors would consider pending requests by several Federal Reserve Banks to reduce the discount rate by 25 basis points. At the time of this conference call meeting, no pending requests for a 50 basis point reduction were outstanding, but the press release would indicate that the Board would be prepared to consider requests for further reductions of 25 basis points if they were received.
