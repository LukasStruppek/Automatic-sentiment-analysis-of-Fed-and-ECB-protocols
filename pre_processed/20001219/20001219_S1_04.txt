Industrial production declined slightly in October and November following a moderate third-quarter increase that was well below the pace of expansion recorded during the first half of the year. Utilities output surged in November in response to unseasonably cold weather across much of the country while mining activity changed little. In manufacturing, motor vehicle output was scaled back further in November, and there also were widespread declines in industries not directly affected by conditions in the motor vehicle sector. Although the production of high-tech equipment was still trending up, growth continued to slow from the extraordinarily rapid increases of earlier in the year. The weakening of factory output in November was reflected in a further decline in the rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing to a point somewhat below its long-term average.
