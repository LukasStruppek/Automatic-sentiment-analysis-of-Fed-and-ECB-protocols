Around the nation, labor markets conditions were reported to be stable to improving, and meeting participants perceived that slack in labor markets was gradually diminishing. In general, business executives indicated that labor was readily available, although again workers with certain skills and in certain occupations, such as trucking, were becoming increasingly difficult to hire. Some commented that the failure of labor force participation to rise as expected as the expansion gained momentum likely portended somewhat weaker labor force growth than previously anticipated; such a development, at the margin, would tend to reduce the expansion of potential output. Still, pressures on prices stemming from labor costs seemed well contained and were expected to remain damped in coming quarters. National data and anecdotal information suggested that wages generally continued to increase moderately. However, health-care expenses were a persistent source of pressure on costs.
