Activity in the housing market continued to expand early this year. Starts of single-family homes in January and February were well above their fourth-quarter pace, although indicators of future production pointed to some slowing. Similarly, in the multifamily sector, starts increased substantially in the first two months of the year but appeared poised to moderate this month. Although both new and existing home sales declined somewhat in January, demand continued to be supported by low mortgage rates.
