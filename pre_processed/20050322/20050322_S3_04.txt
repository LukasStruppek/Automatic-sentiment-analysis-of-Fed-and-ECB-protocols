Some participants mentioned that expansion abroad was apparently strengthening early this year, particularly in emerging-market economies. This development, in turn, was likely to help support U.S. exports. Several participants noted that past declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were contributing to U.S. economic activity. Tourism from abroad, for example, was being spurred by relative currency values. At the same time, though, it was recognized that growth in U.S. domestic demand would likely continue to be met in part by imports, tending to trim the increase in domestic output.
