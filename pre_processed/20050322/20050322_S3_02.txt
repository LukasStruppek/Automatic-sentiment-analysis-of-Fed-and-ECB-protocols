Many participants noted that the most recent data and business commentary indicated that investment was running considerably stronger in the first quarter of the year than had previously been anticipated. Underlying trends in capital spending appeared to be more robust than had earlier been recognized, perhaps partly in response to unusually supportive financial conditions, and that strength was thought likely to carry forward. Business contacts were more confident about economic prospects, and that confidence was bolstering firms' willingness to invest. Anecdotal information suggested that firms were investing in part to expand capacity and in part to boost productivity and lower costs. Some investment was being prompted by a need to replace equipment that was becoming obsolete, in part because of the higher level of energy prices. Increased demand was reported for a wide variety of categories of capital goods, ranging from several types of heavy equipment, including trucks, farm machinery, and construction equipment, to software and high-tech equipment. Nonresidential construction, however, remained soft in many regions, damped by relatively high vacancy rates for office buildings and other commercial real estate.
