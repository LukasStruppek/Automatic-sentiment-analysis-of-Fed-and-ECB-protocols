Increased inventory accumulation contributed significantly to the rise in economic output in the fourth quarter of last year and appeared likely to make an additional contribution in the first quarter of this year. In January, manufacturers' book-value inventories increased at nearly twice the rate seen in the fourth quarter, while wholesale and retail inventories about kept pace with the advance in the previous quarter. The rapid buildup in inventories left the inventory-to-sales ratio unchanged rather than on the downtrend of recent years. However, the available evidence suggested that firms generally were not uncomfortable with their inventory positions.
