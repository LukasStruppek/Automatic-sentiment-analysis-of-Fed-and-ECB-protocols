Residential sales and construction were described as very strong in many parts of the country and indeed were being held down in some areas by low inventories of housing available for sale and a limited supply of qualified construction workers. Some members commented that housing construction backlogs and unusually mild winter weather in many areas had sustained a high level of housing construction in recent months. Looking ahead, however, members observed that residential building activity appeared to have peaked in some areas and an oversupply of apartments was reported in a few major cities. More generally, the rise in mortgage rates since last fall and some softening of demand indicators pointed to less strength in the housing sector. Even so, the outlook for jobs and income and the buildup of financial wealth constituted favorable home affordability factors that appeared likely to support a continuing high level of housing demand, especially in the single-family sector.
