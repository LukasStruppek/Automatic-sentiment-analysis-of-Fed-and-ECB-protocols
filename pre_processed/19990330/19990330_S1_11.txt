The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened substantially in January from its fourth-quarter average. The value of exports fell for a third straight month and reached its lowest level since last August; half of the drop was in agricultural products. The value of imports retraced in January most of its December decline, with sizable increases recorded for imported consumer goods, computers, and motor vehicles from Canada. The economies of many of the major foreign industrial countries faltered in the fourth quarter. Japan recorded a fifth straight quarterly decline in economic activity, and growth in real output weakened in the euro area and remained sluggish in the United Kingdom. By contrast, economic activity rebounded in Canada. Elsewhere, while economic activity continued to decline in Latin America and Russia, there were indications that some Asian economies might be bottoming out and that recovery might be under way in Korea.
