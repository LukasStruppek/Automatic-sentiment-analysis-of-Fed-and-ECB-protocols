All the members endorsed a proposal to retain the existing symmetry of the directive with respect to possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. While many believed that the next policy move likely would be in the direction of some tightening, such an outcome was not a foregone conclusion, and in any event the timing of the next policy action was highly uncertain. It also was noted that a biased directive would not be consistent with the members' view that a policy adjustment was unlikely in the period just ahead. Moreover, while the Committee's disclosure procedures do not always require the immediate announcement of a shift in symmetry, the members agreed that were they to announce a shift to a tightening bias, it would likely have in current circumstances a relatively pronounced and undesired effect on financial markets. In particular, the markets might well build in higher odds of a policy tightening move at the May or June meetings than currently was consistent with the members' thinking. It also seemed desirable to defer any change in the directive and await further developments relating to the hostilities in the Balkans.
