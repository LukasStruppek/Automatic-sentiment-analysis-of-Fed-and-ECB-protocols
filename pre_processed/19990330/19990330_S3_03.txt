With regard to developments in key expenditure sectors of the economy, the members anticipated that growth in consumer spending would retain considerable upward momentum, given their expectations of favorable fundamentals such as further expansion in employment and incomes, the rise in financial wealth that had continued through the first quarter, and ready access to consumer credit. Some also referred to the currently elevated level of consumer confidence. As time went on, however, it seemed unlikely that growth in consumer spending would be sustained at its recent exceptional pace. The accumulation of durable goods by consumers in recent years should at some point inhibit further large increases in spending for such goods. Moreover, the favorable effect of the extended run-up in stock market wealth evidently had been a factor in bolstering consumer confidence and willingness to spend. While the course of stock market prices could not reliably be predicted, the market's stimulative effect on spending was likely to wane over time in the absence of further appreciable advances in prices. Current indications of some softening in home sales and reduced mortgage refinancing activity, should they persist, also augured less stimulus to consumer spending in coming quarters.
