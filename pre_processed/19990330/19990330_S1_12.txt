Inflation remained subdued in early 1999. Both the total and core measures of consumer prices increased only slightly in January and February, and core inflation for the twelve months ended in February was somewhat lower than for the year-earlier period. At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy changed little over January and February. For the twelve months ended in February, core producer price inflation was somewhat higher than for the year-earlier period, but the pickup partly reflected the large increase in tobacco prices that resulted from the settlement of the lawsuit brought by state attorneys general. Average hourly earnings of private production or nonsupervisory workers increased moderately on balance over the January-February period. The rise in average hourly earnings for the year ended in February was noticeably smaller than that for the year-earlier period.
