The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economic expansion remained robust early in the year. Consumer spending was particularly strong, and housing starts climbed higher. While growth of business capital spending moderated somewhat after a fourth-quarter surge, it was still quite rapid. Heavy competition from imports damped the rise of industrial production; however, employment expansion remained brisk and labor markets tight. Price inflation was still low.
