Total business inventories changed little in January and stocks generally were at comfortable levels, though conditions varied across industries. Manufacturing stocks fell in January, largely reflecting further reductions in inventories of aircraft and parts, and the aggregate stock-sales ratio for the sector was at the bottom of its range over the past twelve months. In the wholesale sector, a reduction in inventories in January was concentrated in motor vehicles. The decline in stocks was closely paralleled by a drop in sales, and the aggregate inventory-sales ratio for the sector stayed around the top of its range over the past twelve months. Retail inventories increased considerably in January, but with sales growing rapidly, the aggregate inventory-sales ratio remained at the bottom of its range over the past year.
