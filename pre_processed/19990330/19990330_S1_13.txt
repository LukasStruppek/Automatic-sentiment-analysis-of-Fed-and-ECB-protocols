At its meeting on February 2-3, 1999, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 4-3/4 percent and that did not contain any bias relating to the direction of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. The Committee judged this policy stance to be consistent with its objectives of fostering high employment and sustained low inflation and, over the near term at least, viewed the risks to this outlook as reasonably well balanced.
