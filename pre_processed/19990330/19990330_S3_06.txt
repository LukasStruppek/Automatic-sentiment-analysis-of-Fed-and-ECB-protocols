Relatively heavy spending on imports owing to strong domestic demand and low prices likely would exert a continuing negative effect on net exports over the next several quarters. Nevertheless, demand for U.S. exports could begin to pick up, given what now appeared to be improved prospects for economic activity in several emerging market economies. Financial market conditions had become more settled in a number of these economies, and contagion from developments in Brazil now seemed to present a reduced threat to that nation's trading partners. Even so, foreign-sector forecasts--for industrial as well as emerging market economies--remained subject to considerable downside risk, including uncertainties stemming from the recent flare-up of hostilities in the Balkans.
