The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would gradually moderate to a rate commensurate with the growth of the economy's estimated potential. Growth of private final demand would be damped by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects stemming from earlier large increases in equity prices and by slower growth of spending on consumer durables, housing units, and business equipment after the earlier buildup in the stocks of these items. The lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, though diminishing, restraint on the demand for U.S. exports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products. Pressures on labor resources were likely to remain substantial. Price inflation was projected to rise somewhat over the projection horizon, largely as a result of an expected upward trend in energy prices.
