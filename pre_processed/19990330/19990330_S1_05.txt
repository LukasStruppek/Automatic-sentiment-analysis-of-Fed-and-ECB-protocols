Nonfarm payroll employment posted sizable further gains in January and February. Hiring in construction and retail trade was notably strong, and employment in the service industries continued to trend higher. By contrast, manufacturing suffered further job losses. The civilian unemployment rate, at 4.4 percent in February, stayed in the narrow 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent range that had prevailed since spring 1998.
