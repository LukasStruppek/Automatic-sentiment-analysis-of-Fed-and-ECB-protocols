The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Total nonfarm payroll employment was up slightly in October after declining in the previous two months, and the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 7.4 percent. Industrial production rose somewhat in October. Retail sales increased considerably in September and October. There was some strengthening in residential construction activity over the summer months. Outlays for business equipment have continued to increase, and recent data on orders for nondefense capital goods point to further growth in the near term; expenditures for nonresidential construction have remained weak. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened somewhat in July-August from its average rate in the second quarter. Recent data on wages and prices have been mixed but suggest on balance a continuing trend toward lower inflation.
