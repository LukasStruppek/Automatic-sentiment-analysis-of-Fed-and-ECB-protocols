[" In their discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, a majority of the members favored a symmetric directive. While additional policy tightening might be needed at some point, it did not appear very likely that developments during the intermeeting period would require a further policy move. Some added that inflation remained quiescent and the near-term onset of an appreciable slowing of the expansion to a rate more in line with the economy's potential could not be ruled out. Accordingly, they felt that the directive should not establish a presumption about further near-term policy tightening. Other members believed that growth of the economy was not likely to slow enough to alleviate excess demands for resources and that additional tightening would be needed sooner rather than later to moderate inflationary pressures and prolong the expansion. In their view, the outlook called for vigilance and the maintenance of an asymmetric directive with a bias toward tightening, but they could accept a symmetric directive with careful monitoring of new developments for any signs of the need for prompt action.
