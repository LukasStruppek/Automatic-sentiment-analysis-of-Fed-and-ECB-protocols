[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy had continued to expand at a relatively robust pace in early 1997 after strengthening markedly in the fourth quarter of 1996. Much of the more recent growth reflected further acceleration in consumer spending, but business capital expenditures, housing activity, and an upturn in inventory investment also had contributed to the recent increase in total expenditures. By contrast, available data pointed to a sharp drop in net exports after a surge in the fourth quarter. To meet the strong aggregate demand, employment had recorded another large advance in early 1997 and industrial production had risen somewhat further. The underlying trend in consumer price inflation had remained subdued, but the increase in average hourly earnings had continued to edge higher early this year. ']
