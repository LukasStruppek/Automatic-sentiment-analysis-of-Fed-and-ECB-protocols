[' The data on worker compensation were somewhat mixed, but they suggested some acceleration on balance. Members noted that the damping effects of some temporary factors on labor costs could well begin to wane soon, if they had not already begun to do so. These included the possibility that job security concerns might be diminishing after an extended period of rapid job growth and low unemployment. The downward trend in medical cost increases might be in the process of shifting to a flat, if not a rising, gradient according to informed observers. Moreover, as the rise in labor force participation depleted the pool of available workers, less productive workers would tend to be hired, with adverse effects on productivity and costs. The members recognized that even though aggregate demand pressures seemed to be pressing increasingly on available producer resources, it was not possible to forecast with confidence when the period of favorable price behavior would end. Even so, it was clear that inflationary developments in the economy had become a matter of more urgent concern for monetary policy. ']
