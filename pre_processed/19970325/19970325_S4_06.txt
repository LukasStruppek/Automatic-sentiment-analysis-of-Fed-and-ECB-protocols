[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that relatively strong economic growth has continued in the first quarter. Private nonfarm payroll employment increased substantially further in January and February, and the civilian unemployment rate, at 5.3 percent in February, was unchanged from its level in the second half of 1996. Industrial production rose moderately on balance in January and February. Nominal retail sales increased sharply further over January and February after a considerable advance in the fourth quarter. Housing activity strengthened markedly over January and February, though much of the rise probably related to unusually favorable weather. Recent data on orders and contracts point to a further sizable gain in business fixed investment in the first quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in January from its temporarily depressed rate in the fourth quarter. Underlying price inflation has remained subdued. ']
