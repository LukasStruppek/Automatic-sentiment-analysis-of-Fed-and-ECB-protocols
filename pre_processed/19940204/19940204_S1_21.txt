[' Business inventories remained generally well aligned with sales through November, the most recent month for which complete data were available. In manufacturing, inventory stocks fell in December after edging lower in November: with brisk gains in shipments in both months, the ratio of stocks to shipments fell further from levels that already were low by historical standards. At the wholesale level, inventories rose moderately in November after little change in the preceding two months. The inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector had changed little since May. Retail inventories expanded substantially in November for a third straight month. The buildup of stocks might have been in anticipation of robust holiday sales, but for some retail businesses, particularly general merchandise stores, the increases coincided with weak sales. For the retail sector as a whole, the inventory-to-sales ratio was up slightly in November. ']
