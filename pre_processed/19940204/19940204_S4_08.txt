[' The information reviewed at this meeting indicates a strong advance in economic activity during the closing months of 1993, and the limited data available for the early weeks of this year suggest appreciable further gains. The January labor market data were complicated by statistical revisions and weather-related reporting problems; however, a variety of indicators pointed convincingly to a continuing expansion of employment. Industrial production increased sharply in the fourth quarter and appears to have risen considerably further in January. Consumer spending and housing activity posted solid gains in late 1993, and strong sales of motor vehicles in January suggested continued buoyancy in consumer demand. Trends in contracts and orders point to further sizable gains in business fixed investment. The average nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in October-November was about the same as its average rate in the third quarter. Over the latter part of 1993, increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices, excluding their food and energy components, were somewhat larger than earlier in the year and prices of a number of commodities also turned up recently.
