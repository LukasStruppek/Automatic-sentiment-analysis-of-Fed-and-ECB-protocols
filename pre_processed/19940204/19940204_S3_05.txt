[' Turning to prospective developments in key sectors of the economy, the members anticipated that the expansion in consumer expenditures would be well maintained during 1994, though the growth in such spending probably would moderate to a pace more in line with gains in disposable income. The available data on retail sales since the holiday period were still limited, but anecdotal reports pointed to continuing momentum in several parts of the country. Winter storms had hindered sales in a number of areas, but according to some retail contacts the adverse effects were likely to be temporary. In any event, the very rapid rates of growth in sales of automobiles and other consumer durables were not sustainable, and already high consumer debt ratios would be a further inhibiting factor. It was noted in this connection that consumer debt had become more concentrated over the course of recent years among consumer groups that were most likely to borrow to help finance their spending, with the result that the ability of such consumers to incur additional indebtedness could be diminished. Higher taxes confronting some households also were cited as a negative factor in the outlook for the consumer sector. On balance, however, while the prospects for consumer spending clearly were not free of uncertainty, the marked improvement in consumer confidence and favorable financial conditions would provide a setting conducive to sustained moderate growth in consumer expenditures.
