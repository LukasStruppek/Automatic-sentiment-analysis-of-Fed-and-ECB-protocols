[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the economy had entered the new year with appreciable forward momentum and that the expansion was likely to be sustained over the year ahead at a pace somewhat above the economy's long-run potential. The very rapid rate of economic growth now indicated for the fourth quarter of 1993 clearly could not be maintained. Much of the recent impetus to the expansion stemmed from a surge in expenditures on housing, business equipment, and consumer durables. Such spending had reached a very high level in relation to underlying demands so that the pace of additional increases undoubtedly would moderate during the course of 1994. Still, the economic expansion seemed to have considerable momentum, largely as a consequence of diminishing balance sheet constraints and generally favorable financial conditions spurred by a highly accommodative monetary policy. As a consequence, a number of members expressed the view that the risks were on the upside of a moderate growth forecast. In the context of low and decreasing slack in the economy, little further progress would be made toward price stability in 1994, and there was a distinct risk of higher inflation at some point if monetary policy were not adjusted. While broad measures of inflation did not on the whole suggest any changes in inflation trends, some members noted that a number of commodity prices had turned up in recent months, and they referred to still scattered but increasing anecdotal reports that some business firms were paying slightly higher prices for various materials purchased for use in the production process.
