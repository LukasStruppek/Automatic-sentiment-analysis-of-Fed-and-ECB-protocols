[' In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates in 1994 that it had established on a tentative basis at its meeting on July 6-7, 1993. The tentative ranges included expansion of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had been set provisionally at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. All of these ranges were unchanged from those that the Committee had set for 1993: the latter had been adjusted down to take account of ongoing increases in velocity. ']
