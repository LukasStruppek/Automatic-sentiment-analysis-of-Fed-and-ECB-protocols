[" The members acknowledged that broad measures of prices and wages had displayed mixed patterns over recent months and that on the whole they did not yet point to any clear change in inflation trends. However, some other indicators were more disquieting. One example was the growing, though still limited, number of anecdotal reports of shortages of skilled workers in some parts of the country or occupations, notably construction. Moreover, there were more reports of rising prices for products being purchased by business firms for use in the production process and in turn of successful efforts by businesses to raise their own prices in order to pass on higher costs or to improve their profit margins. More generally, many commodity prices had increased over the past several weeks. On the positive side, competitive pressures remained intense in many markets, augmented in markets for numerous products by competition from foreign producers. Some members also commented that the tradeoff between economic growth and inflation would be improved over the year ahead to the extent that the credibility of the System's anti-inflationary policy was maintained.
