[' Producer prices of finished goods were down slightly in December after being unchanged in November. Excluding the food and energy components, producer prices edged higher in December and were up slightly for the year as a whole. At the retail level, consumer prices rose modestly in November and December, with energy price declines holding down the increase in the overall index. For items other than food and energy, prices advanced in the two months at a slightly faster pace than that seen over previous months of the year; for 1993 as a whole, the increase was about the same as in 1992. Hourly compensation of private industry workers increased in the fourth quarter at the same pace as in the third quarter. For 1993, the rise in hourly compensation was little changed from the previous year. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers rose sharply in January, but for the twelve months ended in January, the increase was the same as that recorded for the previous twelve months.
