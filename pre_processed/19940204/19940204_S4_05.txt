[" At this meeting, Committee members discussed and agreed on a proposal to have the Chairman announce the Committee's short-term policy decision promptly. The purpose of such an announcement, which would be a departure from past Committee practice, was to avoid any misinterpretation of the Committee's action and its purpose. Because this would be the first tightening policy action in a long time, it was likely to attract considerable attention. The Committee did not intend this announcement to set any precedents or to imply any commitments regarding the announcement of its decisions in the future. That matter would be reviewed along with other issues relating to the disclosure of Committee information at a later meeting. "]
