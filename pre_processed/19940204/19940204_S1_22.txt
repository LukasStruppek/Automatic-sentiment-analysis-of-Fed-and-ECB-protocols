[' The average nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit for the October-November period was about the same as its average rate in the third quarter. The value of exports was up for the two-month period, with the increase occurring largely in machinery, automotive products, and aircraft. The higher value of imports for the two-month period reflected, as had been the case earlier in 1993, greater imports of consumer goods, automotive products, and machinery. Trends in economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries appeared to have diverged further in the fourth quarter. Moderate growth appeared to be continuing in Canada and the United Kingdom, but economic activity seemed to be growing more slowly or to have turned down in Japan, western Germany, and France. ']
