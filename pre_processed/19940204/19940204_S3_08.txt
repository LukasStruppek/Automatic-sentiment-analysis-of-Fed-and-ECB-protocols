[' Fiscal policy and foreign trade had exerted retarding effects on the economy in 1993. While the response of the economy to fiscal restraint and the outlook for export markets remained subject to substantial uncertainty, both fiscal policy and the trade deficit were expected at this point to be less negative factors in the performance of the economy during 1994. With regard to the outlook for fiscal policy, the downtrend in defense spending was projected to moderate and to contribute to a smaller net decline in overall federal government expenditures on goods and services in 1994. It was noted that the widespread political support of efforts to curtail federal government deficits could be expected to continue to contain new federal spending initiatives. With regard to the outlook for U.S. exports, more accommodative fiscal or monetary policies abroad were expected to foster a gradual improvement in rates of economic growth in major foreign industrial countries with beneficial effects on the demand from those countries for U.S. goods and services. One member also commented that NAFTA already seemed to be having a favorable effect on some exports to Mexico. ']
