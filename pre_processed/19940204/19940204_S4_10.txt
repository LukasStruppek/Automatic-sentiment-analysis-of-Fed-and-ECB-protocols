[" Growth of M2 and M3 was relatively slow over December and January. From the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993, M2 and M3 are estimated to have grown at rates slightly above the lower ends of the Committee's ranges for the year. Private borrowing has picked up in recent months and total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a moderate rate in the fourth quarter; for the year, nonfinancial debt is estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.
