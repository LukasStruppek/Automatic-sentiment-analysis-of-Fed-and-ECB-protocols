[' Industrial production increased appreciably further in December, and the available information suggested a considerable rise in January. In December, the advance in manufacturing was led by the motor vehicle and computing equipment industries. Sizable increases in materials and construction supplies also were recorded. On the other hand, the output of consumer goods other than motor vehicles was sluggish, and the production of aircraft and defense and space equipment continued to shrink. Total utilization of manufacturing capacity rose again in December and reached a relatively high level, judged against historical experience. ']
