[' The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic expansion would slow from the very strong pace of the fourth quarter, but that the economy still would advance in 1994 at a rate somewhat in excess of the growth of potential. The severe winter weather over much of the country and the California earthquake would tend to distort economic indicators for the early part of the year: however, taken together, these developments were not expected to have a material or lasting effect on the overall level of activity or prices. Consumer spending, which for some time had tended to outpace the growth of disposable income, was projected to increase at a rate more in line with incomes. Business fixed investment was expected to decelerate gradually from the very rapid rate of 1993, reflecting the diminishing effect of the earlier pickup in output growth, the slower growth of corporate cash flow, and a less rapid decline in the cost of capital. Homebuilding activity, driven by the greatly improved affordability of housing and increased confidence in employment prospects, was anticipated to continue at a relatively brisk pace through much of the year. Exports were projected to strengthen somewhat, bolstered by some pickup in foreign economic growth, and fiscal restraint was expected to exert a reduced drag on spending. In light of the limited margins of slack in labor and product markets that were anticipated to prevail over the forecast horizon, the ongoing expansion was projected to be associated with only a slight further reduction in the core rate of inflation.
