[' The improvement in consumer sentiment together with the availability of relatively low cost financing had fostered very strong growth in housing construction over the closing months of 1993 and, adjusting for seasonal weather conditions, anecdotal reports from many areas suggested a continued robust performance in this sector of the economy in the early weeks of this year. The strength in housing activity had induced increases in the costs of lumber and other building materials, and shortages of skilled construction workers were reported in some areas. Despite these developments, prices of new homes did not appear at this point to be under significant upward pressure. Looking ahead, with housing construction already at high levels, further gains over the course of 1994 were expected to be substantially below those recorded in recent quarters. ']
