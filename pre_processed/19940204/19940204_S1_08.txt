[' Mr. Jordan dissented because he felt that providing funds to the Treasury using a warehousing arrangement was, in effect, a loan to the Treasury. In his opinion, direct financing of government operations by the central bank is inappropriate and could compromise the effective conduct of monetary policy.

Accordingly, he did not want to retain the standing $5 billion authorization. ']
