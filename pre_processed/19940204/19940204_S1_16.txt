[' Real business fixed investment recorded a very large increase in the fourth quarter. Business spending for equipment, notably for information processing equipment, was up sharply for a seventh straight quarter. The strength evident in recent orders for nondefense capital goods pointed to further gains in shipments of these goods in early 1994. Outlays for nonresidential structures in the fourth quarter posted their largest quarterly rise in six years; the increases were spread across a broad array of categories other than office buildings. Construction permits continued to rise in the fourth quarter, suggesting further growth of investment in nonresidential structures in the near term. ']
