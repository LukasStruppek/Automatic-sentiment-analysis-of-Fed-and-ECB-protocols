[' Assessment of the January labor market data was complicated by statistical revisions and weather-related reporting problems, but a variety of indicators pointed convincingly to a further strengthening in the demand for labor. Total nonfarm payroll employment posted a small gain in January after a sizable December increase. Manufacturing employment rose for a fourth consecutive month, with gains again concentrated in motor vehicles. Construction payrolls edged down, evidently reflecting the adverse effects of severe winter weather. The total number of jobs in the services industries was unchanged in January, but the inclement weather apparently held down employment in some segments of this sector as well. The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers rose in January to its highest level in almost five years; for manufacturing, the average workweek remained at its post-World War II high for a third consecutive month. The civilian unemployment rate, calculated on a new basis, was 6.7 percent in January. ']
