[' Open market operations were directed throughout the period since the meeting on June 30-July 1 toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, and the federal funds rate averaged a little above the intended level of 5-1/2 percent. Most other interest rates fell slightly on balance over the intermeeting period in response to market assessments that worsening conditions in Asia, Latin America, and Russia portended slower growth in U.S. output and inflation over an extended period ahead. Declines in Treasury yields also reflected a continuing flight toward safety and quality from the persisting turbulence in foreign markets. In an atmosphere of increasing concerns about the prospects for corporate earnings, share prices in U.S. equity markets remained volatile and major indexes declined appreciably on balance over the intermeeting period.
