[' The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that domestic final demand has continued to expand at a robust pace, but overall economic activity has been adversely affected by the strike at General Motors and developments in Asia. Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand through July and the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.5 percent. Industrial production declined considerably in June and July; most of the drop over the two months reflected the GM strike. A decline in total retail sales in July was more than accounted for by a sharp contraction in spending for motor vehicles. Residential sales and construction have remained exceptionally strong in recent months. Available indicators point to continued growth in business capital spending, although apparently at a more moderate pace than earlier in the year. Business inventory accumulation slowed sharply in the spring. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially further in the second quarter. Trends in wages and prices have remained stable in recent months. ']
