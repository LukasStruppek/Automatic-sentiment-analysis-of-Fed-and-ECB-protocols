[" In the Committee's discussion of the outlook for wages and prices, members commented that the rate of inflation in consumer prices was difficult to characterize with precision because alterna- tive price indexes provided different measurement results; in particular, chain price indexes for consumption expenditures showed substantially less inflation than the CPI. Even so, it was clear on the basis of any measure that consumer prices and inflation more generally had remained remarkably subdued in the context of very tight labor markets and upward pressure on labor compensation. And whatever the explanation, it seemed that the economy had been less prone to rising inflation than it had been historically under similarly tight labor market conditions. The members acknowledged that a number of special factors were contributing to the relatively benign inflation climate. Those factors included the appreciation of the dollar; declines in many commodity prices, notably that of oil; ample industrial capacity; and evidently diminished inflation expectations. Moreover, substantial gains in productivity were muting the effects of rising labor compensation on unit costs, and vigorous competition in numerous markets was continuing to make it very difficult or impossible for business firms to raise their prices to cover rising costs or enhance profit margins. Against this backdrop, members remained persuaded that a significant rise in price inflation was not likely to occur in the nearer term. "]
