[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially further in the second quarter; the value of exports of goods and services declined for a second straight quarter, while the value of imports continued to rise, though at a somewhat reduced pace. Much of the decline in exports in the second quarter was in capital goods, but there also were noticeable decreases in most other major trade categories. The increase in imports was concentrated in imported consumer goods, aircraft, and steel. Economic activity in most of the major foreign industrial countries continued to expand, though at a slower rate, in the second quarter. In Japan, however, economic activity appeared to have contracted sharply further in the second quarter. In most other Asian economies, currencies and equity prices were under downward pressure, and in Russia, asset values plummeted in often disorderly markets. Risk spreads on dollar-denominated debt widened substantially, not only in Russia but for Latin American issuers as well. ']
