[' In their review of developments in key expenditure sectors of the domestic economy, members observed that over the first half of the year the strength in domestic final demand, notably in the consumer and business investment sectors, had more than offset the negative effects of developments in the foreign sector and other factors. In the consumer sector, the outlook for further sizable increases in spending was buttressed by unusually favorable underlying factors, including solid ongoing gains in employment and incomes and substantial further increases in household net worth this year. A pause in the robust gains in retail sales in early summer was accounted for in part by limited inventories of new motor vehicles associated with the now-settled GM strike. While a variety of factors pointed to sustained growth in consumer spending, a less ebullient stock market, should it persist, would foster more moderate expansion in consumer spending, perhaps at a pace more in line with the rise in consumer incomes, or at an even slower pace if consumer confidence were adversely affected by developments in financial markets.
