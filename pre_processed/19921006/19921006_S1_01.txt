The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is expanding at a subdued pace. Total nonfarm payroll employment declined somewhat further in September, but the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 7.5 percent. Industrial production is estimated to have declined appreciably since July. Real personal consumption expenditures appear to have risen moderately in the third quarter. Data on housing have been mixed, but on balance they continue to suggest a gradual uptrend in housing expenditures. Recent data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods indicate slower growth in outlays for business equipment, while expenditures for non residential construction have been weak. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened somewhat in July from its average rate in the second quarter. Incoming data on wages and prices suggest that inflation is slowing.
