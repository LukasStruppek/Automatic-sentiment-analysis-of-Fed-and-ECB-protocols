Short-term interest rates have declined somewhat, while longer-term rates are about unchanged since the Committee meeting on August 18. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fluctuated widely over the intermeeting period but ended the period higher on balance. Expansion of M2 and M3 resumed in August, though at fairly slow rates, and limited growth appears to have continued in September. Through September both aggregates were estimated to have grown at rates somewhat below the lower ends of the ranges established by the Committee for the year.
