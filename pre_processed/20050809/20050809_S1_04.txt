Industrial production picked up in June. A jump in utilities output, apparently owing to unseasonably warm weather, accounted for more than half of the gain. Motor vehicle production also rose a good bit, but the pace of production growth in the high-tech sector was sluggish, reflecting a decline in the output of communications equipment. Overall capacity utilization moved up to its highest level since December 2000.
