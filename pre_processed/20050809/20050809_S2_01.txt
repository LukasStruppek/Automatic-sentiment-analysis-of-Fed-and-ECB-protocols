In the forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff raised its projection for economic growth over the remainder of 2005 in light of incoming data suggesting greater near-term momentum in aggregate demand. At the same time, however, it trimmed the growth rate forecast for 2006, reflecting the effects of higher energy prices, higher long-term interest rates, and the somewhat slower growth of productive capacity implied by the annual revisions to the national accounts. The output gap was predicted to be essentially closed by the end of this year. Inventory investment was projected to resume contributing to GDP growth over the second half of this year, after the sharp swing toward inventory runoffs in the second quarter. Growth in consumer spending was expected to firm in the third quarter, buoyed by motor vehicle spending, before falling back in the fourth quarter. With housing starts essentially flat, residential investment was projected to decelerate substantially over the remainder of this year. Business investment was predicted to continue to rise at a moderate pace, benefiting from still-accommodative financial conditions and the ongoing need to replace depreciating equipment and software. The recent improvement in the trade balance was expected to be transitory. Notwithstanding recent benign readings on inflation, the forecast for core PCE inflation was raised somewhat, owing in part to the recent further rise in energy prices and, in light of the revisions to historical data, a higher assumed trajectory for the nonmarket component of core PCE prices.
