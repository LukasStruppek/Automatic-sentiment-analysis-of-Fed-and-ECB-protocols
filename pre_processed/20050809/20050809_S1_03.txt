Payroll employment grew in June and July at a pace that was roughly on par with that over the preceding six months. Hiring in the services and construction sectors remained strong, but the manufacturing sector posted further small job losses. With employment increasing and the average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers unchanged over these two months, aggregate hours continued to firm. The unemployment rate dipped to 5.0 percent in June and held steady at that rate in July. Initial claims for unemployment insurance remained at low levels.
