Regarding the federal budget, a recent narrowing of the deficit was noted, but the improvement appeared to be attributable to cyclical factors and to increases in the level of tax collections that were not likely to be repeated. Few signs were evident that greater fiscal discipline in the budget process would emerge any time soon. As a result, federal deficits were expected to continue to act as a considerable drain on national saving over the longer run.
