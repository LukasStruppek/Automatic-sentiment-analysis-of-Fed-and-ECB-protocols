M2 continued to grow sluggishly on balance over June and July. Small time deposits, whose rates of return adjust relatively quickly to changes in market rates, expanded briskly. However, liquid deposits and retail money market mutual funds were little changed on net over these two months. Despite the recent slow growth of M2, its velocity remained low relative to the level that would be expected based on its historical relationship with opportunity cost. The growth of bank credit was restrained in June by a runoff in securities holdings but picked up in July.
