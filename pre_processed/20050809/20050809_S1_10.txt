Consumer prices were about unchanged in June after posting notable increases earlier in the year. Consumer energy prices reversed a small part of their previous run-up, and core consumer inflation remained low. The producer price index was unchanged in June. The annual revisions to the national income and product accounts, which were released in early August, included a substantial upward revision to core PCE inflation for 2004, from 1.6 percent to 2.2 percent, reflecting changes to the nonmarket-based components of the index. Survey measures of near-term inflation expectations edged down in July, and longer-term inflation expectations firmed only a touch. The employment cost index for private industry workers again rose at a modest pace in the second quarter, and increases in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector slowed somewhat from the rapid rate of the first quarter.
