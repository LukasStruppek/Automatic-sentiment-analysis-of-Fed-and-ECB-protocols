Homebuilding generally had remained robust in recent months, as relatively low mortgage interest rates continued to offset weakness in employment and incomes and the negative effects of declining stock market wealth. Most regions continued to report strong housing markets, albeit with evidence of some weakening in sales of high-priced homes in a number of areas. For now, however, there were few signs that overall housing activity might be softening, though members noted that potentially bearish factors relating to the outlook for consumer spending might at some point also affect housing.
