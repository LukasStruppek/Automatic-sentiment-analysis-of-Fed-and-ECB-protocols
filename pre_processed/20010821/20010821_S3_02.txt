Statistical evidence of an ongoing, though gradual, worsening in overall business conditions was supported by anecdotal reports from around the nation. Weakness continued to be concentrated in manufacturing, notably in the high-tech sector and in high-tech service industries. Indications that the softening was spreading more generally were still fairly limited as suggested by employment data and anecdotal reports. At the same time, members cited some still quite tentative signs that declines in manufacturing had slowed or that activity had steadied in some depressed industries.
