The persistence of substantial inventory liquidation was another negative factor in the current performance of the economy. While considerable progress reportedly had been made by numerous business firms in reducing their inventories to bring them into better alignment with sales, a rebound to inventory accumulation did not appear imminent for the economy as a whole. Unexpected weakness in final demands would, of course, lead to additional efforts to pare inventories, which would tend to damp and delay the rebound. Even so, leaner inventories had favorable implications for production going forward.
