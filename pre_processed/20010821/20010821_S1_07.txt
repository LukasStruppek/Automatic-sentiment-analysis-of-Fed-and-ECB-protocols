Growth in consumer spending slowed somewhat in the second quarter, but except for automotive dealers, retailers reported sizable gains in July. Consumer confidence appeared to have stabilized at moderately favorable levels in recent months. Supported by low mortgage rates, residential building activity had held up well this year. In July, single-family starts increased slightly from a strong pace in the first and second quarters, though permits fell marginally. Sales of new homes rose in June (latest data), and sales of existing homes edged down but remained only slightly below their historical peak.
