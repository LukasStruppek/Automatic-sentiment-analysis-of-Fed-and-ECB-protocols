Industrial production edged lower in July after larger drops in each of the previous three months. Motor vehicle assemblies rose markedly, but production of high-tech equipment continued to plummet, registering its largest one-month decline in more than a decade. Outside those two industries, manufacturing production either moved sideways or fell slightly. The rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity was little changed in July and remained well below its long-run average.
