The trade-weighted value of the dollar, after an extended period of strength, fell against most major foreign currencies, with much of the decline occurring in the days just before this meeting. The decline was particularly marked against the yen, the euro, and the Swiss franc. In contrast, the dollar was little changed against the currencies of some major trading partners, including Canada and Mexico.
