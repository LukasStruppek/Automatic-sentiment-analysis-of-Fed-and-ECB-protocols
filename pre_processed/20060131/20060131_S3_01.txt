In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted the slowing in GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2005, but believed that it probably owed in large part to transitory factors and that economic growth would bounce back in the current quarter. In that regard, several high frequency indicators of production, labor markets, and private demand suggested greater underlying strength of late than had been reflected in the most recent GDP data. Over the next couple of years, the economy seemed poised to expand at a moderate rate in the neighborhood of its sustainable pace. Most participants expected core inflation to move up slightly in the near term, reflecting some pass-through of increased energy and other commodity prices. Although heightened inflation pressures could also arise from possible increases in resource utilization, the outlook for economic growth and the stability of inflation expectations suggested that core inflation should remain contained over time.
