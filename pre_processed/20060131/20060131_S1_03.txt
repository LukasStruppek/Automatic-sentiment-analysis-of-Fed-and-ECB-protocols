Labor demand expanded further in the fourth quarter, as private nonfarm payrolls showed large gains in November followed by more-modest gains in December. The average increase over those two months represented sturdy job gains, even after accounting for the likely catch-up in employment following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Several sectors, including manufacturing and several service groups, added vigorously to payrolls in December, but the total for the month was held down by employment declines in a number of sectors, such as retail trade and construction, where seasonal adjustment can be difficult this time of year. Aggregate hours fell slightly in December owing to a decrease in the workweek, but they rose over the fourth quarter as a whole. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.9 percent in part due to the labor force participation rate ticking down.
