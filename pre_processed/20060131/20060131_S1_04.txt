Industrial production rose notably in November and December, boosted by partial recovery from the effects of the hurricanes. Production in the mining industry, which includes oil and gas extraction, increased sharply. Utilities output also popped up in December as temperatures turned unseasonably cold in the first half of the month. Abstracting from the effects of these special factors, underlying activity in the industrial sector advanced moderately. Modest production increases in most manufacturing categories in December, including high-tech, consumer goods, and business equipment, outweighed production declines in the motor vehicles and parts sector. The capacity utilization rate in manufacturing stood a bit above its level of one year ago and near its long-run average.
