Core consumer price inflation remained moderate over the second half of last year. Core prices had posted a string of very low increases last summer, held down in part by falling motor vehicle prices. In recent months, increases in core prices had rebounded. The overall consumer price index edged down further in December in response to substantial declines in its volatile energy price components. However, survey data pointed to large increases in gasoline prices in January, which were due to the backup in crude oil prices. Preliminary survey measures of near-term inflation expectations for January had nonetheless ticked down, continuing the reversal of a sharp increase after the hurricanes last fall, and longer-term inflation expectations had moved lower as well. Input prices increased somewhat less in December, as upward pressure from previous energy price increases receded somewhat. Indeed, the increase in core intermediate producer prices over the year was estimated to be considerably lower than over the previous year. At its December meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4Ĺş percent. In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions, the expansion in economic activity appeared solid. Core inflation had stayed relatively low in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations had remained contained. Nevertheless, the Committee noted that possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices had the potential to add to inflationary pressures. In these circumstances, the Committee believed that some further measured policy firming was likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.
