[' In keeping with the usual practice at meetings when the Committee considers its long-run objectives for growth of the money and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members provided specific individual projections of growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 1994 and 1995. The central tendency of the forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP for 1994 as a whole was 3 to 3-1/4 percent, a little below the rate of growth estimated for the first half of the year; for 1995, the projections had a central tendency of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent. With regard to the expansion of nominal GDP, the forecasts centered on growth rates of 5-1/2 to 6 percent for 1994 and 5 to 5-1/2 percent for 1995. The projections of more moderate growth in economic activity were associated with rates of unemployment in a range of 6 to 6-1/4 percent in the fourth quarters of both 1994 and 1995, about the same as the average unemployment rate in recent months. For the rate of inflation, as measured by the CPI, the projections had a central tendency of 2-3/4 to 3 percent for 1994 and 2-3/4 to 3-1/2 percent for 1995; both ranges represented a slight increase from the average rate over the past year. Favorable developments in the food and energy sectors, which had held down overall inflation measures over the past several quarters, were not expected to continue and the drop in the dollar would be exerting upward pressures on prices in coming quarters.
