[" The broad monetary aggregates were weaker than the Committee anticipated at the time of its previous meeting, with both M2 and M3 declining on average over May and June. The declines appeared to be related in part to the continuing appeal of capital market instruments. More generally, however, the rise in short-and long-term interest rates since the beginning of 1994, coupled with the reluctance of banks and other depository institutions to adjust their offering rates promptly, had produced a widening of the opportunity costs of holding deposits and had led households to move deposit monies into direct and indirect holdings of market instruments. For the year through June, both M2 and M3 were at the bottom of the Committee's ranges for 1994, and total domestic nonfinancial debt had expanded at a moderate rate in the lower half of its monitoring range.
