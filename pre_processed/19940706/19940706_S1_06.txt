[' Nonfarm payroll employment advanced somewhat less rapidly in May after the brisk increases of recent months; however, the average workweek of production and nonsupervisory workers reached its highest level since 1987. The reduction in job gains was widespread by sector--including business services; finance, insurance, and real estate; manufacturing; and construction. Employment in transportation rebounded, reflecting the end of a Teamsters strike. The civilian unemployment rate, measured on the new basis introduced in January, declined sharply in May, to 6.0 percent; the decline might have been overstated as a result of seasonal adjustment problems, but even after correcting for these factors, the unemployment rate had fallen sharply since late 1993.
