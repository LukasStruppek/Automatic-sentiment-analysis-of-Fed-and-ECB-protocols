[' In the discussion of the near-term course of policy, the members took account of the substantial weakness of the dollar in foreign exchange markets over the course of recent weeks. By itself, the drop in the dollar could put some pressure on resources and prices. However, the members agreed that these effects needed to be considered in the context of overall prospects for the economy and financial markets, and policy should not be focused narrowly on the dollar alone. In any case, given the negative sentiment in the foreign exchange markets, the effects on the dollar that would flow from a small change in policy were uncertain. Ultimately, the most effective support that monetary policy could provide for the dollar was to foster the objectives of sustainable economic growth and progress toward price stability. ']
