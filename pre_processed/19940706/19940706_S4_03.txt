[" With regard to possible changes in policy during the intermeeting period, a majority favored a change in the intermeeting instruction in the directive from symmetry to asymmetry toward restraint. Some of the members indicated that near-term developments were not likely to call for an adjustment to policy. Nonetheless, the risk of inflationary momentum in the expansion remained high, given an economy that appeared to be operating at or very close to full capacity, and they believed that the probable direction of the next policy move was likely to be in the direction of restraint. Some emphasized that such a move should be made promptly in response to information suggesting a greater potential for inflation. In the view of many, though not all, members the costs of policy errors were asymmetrical at this point. The costs of reversing a policy stance that turned out to be slightly too tight would be limited to somewhat slower economic growth for a time; the expansion appeared to be so well established at this juncture that the risks of a greater economic adjustment were remote. On the other hand, a policy that turned out to be unduly stimulative would foster greater inflation and inflationary expectations that probably could be reversed only at the cost of considerable disruption in financial markets and the economy. It also was noted that an asymmetric directive would underscore the Committee's determination to resist greater inflation; the asymmetry could be viewed as a logical extension of the strategy adopted in February to move to a policy stance consistent with averting inflationary pressures in a firmly established expansion.
