[" Pursuant to a request from the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, the members considered extending their specific forecasts by an additional year. Many expressed reservations about the reliability and thus the usefulness of numerical forecasts extending relatively far into the future. Moreover, they were concerned about misunderstandings of specific long-range forecasts in relation to the Committee's goals and the ongoing formulation of monetary policy. The members concluded that, on balance, the Committee's policy intentions and expectations would be conveyed more effectively by the Chairman in his upcoming Congressional testimony through a discussion of the important factors bearing on trends in economic growth, prices, and unemployment; the uncertainties involved in projecting such variables; and the role of monetary policy in achieving desired economic goals. In the course of their discussion, Committee members noted that the Administration's medium-term outlook contained reasonable estimates of the trend growth in output. "]
