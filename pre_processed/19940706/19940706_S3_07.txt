[' Members observed that the outlook for exports appeared to have improved and that foreign trade, on net, probably would make a small contribution to economic growth over the next several quarters. Some noted that business contacts were reporting strong foreign demand for various U.S. products. As members had noted at previous meetings, the North American Free Trade Agreement appeared to have stimulated increased trade between Mexico and the United States, although it was still too early to gauge the extent of this development. More generally, the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and a somewhat greater strengthening in the economies of major trading partners than was expected earlier had enhanced the prospects for appreciable growth in U.S. exports, and in the view of at least some members that growth might prove to be considerably greater than was currently projected.
