[" In their review of the Committee's monitoring range for the growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt, the members agreed that the current range for 1994 should be retained. This view took into account staff projections indicating that the debt aggregate was likely to grow within its present range this year, albeit the lower half of that range. Considerable sentiment was expressed, however, for reducing the debt monitoring range for 1995. Debt growth was expected to remain relatively subdued in association with projections of a slower rate of expansion in nominal GDP. Lowering the range would underscore the Committee's view that rapid debt growth, should it materialize and be sustained, could have adverse implications for inflation and financial stability. Members emphasized, however, that action to adjust the debt range did not imply increased Committee emphasis on the debt aggregate, and most believed that the risks of any misinterpretation could be minimized by including an appropriate explanation in the report to Congress.
