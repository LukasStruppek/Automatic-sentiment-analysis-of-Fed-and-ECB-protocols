Jordan and Lindsey dissented from this action, although they agreed that the foreign exchange transactions conducted during the intermeeting period were authorized under the Committee's rules.

In their view, to the extent that repeated intervention failed to achieve stated or perceived objectives, questions would tend to arise about the credibility of monetary policy more generally. "]
