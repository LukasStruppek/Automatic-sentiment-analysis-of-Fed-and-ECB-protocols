[" Prior to the conclusion of this meeting, the members discussed the desirability of announcing the outcome of a meeting when no action to change policy was taken. Views differed on this issue, but most of the members supported a proposal to provide a brief and informal indication that the meeting had ended and that there would be no further announcements. Since early February, a statement had been released after each meeting, all of which had involved policy changes; failure to take some step after this meeting to make clear that there was no change to announce would lead for a time to a heightened degree of uncertainty. With regard to future announcements, it was understood that this issue along with other public disclosure questions would be considered at a later meeting. The Committee's decision regarding announcements would then be made public. "]
