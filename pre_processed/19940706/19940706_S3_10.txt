[" In the Committee's discussion, which as in the past tended to focus on M2, all the members indicated that they were in favor of retaining the current ranges for M2 and M3 for 1994 and extending those ranges on a provisional basis to 1995. In their evaluation of appropriate growth ranges for 1994, the members anticipated that the projected moderation in the expansion of nominal GDP and the likelihood that funds would continue to be diverted from deposits to higher yielding market instruments would be reflected in relatively sluggish growth in M2 and M3 and further increases in their velocity--the ratio of nominal GDP to these monetary measures. In the circumstances, expected growth in M2 and M3 at rates around the lower end of their ranges would be consistent with the Committee's overall objective of fostering financial conditions that would promote sustainable economic growth and contain pressures on prices. Indeed, that objective might even imply a shortfall from one or both of the current ranges, but shortfalls could be tolerated and explained if they reflected greater-than-expected increases in velocity associated with an acceptable economic performance. While growth of the broad monetary aggregates might pick up somewhat next year, it probably would remain damped relative to income. In light of this prospect, and of the uncertainties about appropriate monetary growth in 1995, the Committee decided to carry forward the 1994 ranges, subject to a review early next year. The Committee noted that the current ranges, which had been reduced greatly over the years, could be viewed as long-run benchmarks for monetary growth consistent with maximum sustainable economic expansion in a noninflationary environment, if there were a return to more normal velocity behavior. The Committee recognized that considerable uncertainty about the behavior of velocity was likely to persist and that a broad range of financial and economic indicators, in addition to the monetary aggregates, would need to be monitored in determining the appropriate course for monetary policy.
