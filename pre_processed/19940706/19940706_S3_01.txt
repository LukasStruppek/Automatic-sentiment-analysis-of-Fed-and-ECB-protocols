[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the expansion continued to display considerable momentum, with business activity apparently still increasing at a pace above the economy's long-run growth potential. At the same time, indications of some slowing in aggregate demand had tended to increase over the last few months. The extent of that slowing remained subject to considerable uncertainty, especially in light of somewhat disparate data on employment and spending. Nonetheless, it was generally agreed that, in the context of appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, some moderation in economic growth to a pace closer to that of the economy's long-run potential was a reasonable expectation. Such a slowing seemed necessary to forestall a buildup of inflation pressures in the view of many members. A number of members emphasized that remaining margins of unemployed labor and other production resources, while difficult to assess, now appeared to be quite limited. Although views differed to some degree, the members generally concluded that the various factors affecting the course of inflation were likely to result, on balance, in little change, or perhaps a small rise, in inflation over the 1994-1995 forecast horizon. Some members regarded the risks of a significant divergence from their forecasts of economic growth and inflation as fairly evenly balanced in either direction, but most believed that those risks were tilted to the upside.
