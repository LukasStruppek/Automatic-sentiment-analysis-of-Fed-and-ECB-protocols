[' Real personal consumption expenditures fell on balance in April and May after a strong advance earlier in the year, but the level of expenditures for the two months combined was a little above the first-quarter average. The recent slowdown in consumer spending in large part reflected reduced outlays for motor vehicles. Spending for durable goods other than motor vehicles increased over April and May at about the first-quarter pace. Outlays for nondurable goods were down on balance in April and May, while spending for services in May more than reversed a small April decline. Housing activity had rebounded from weather disruptions early in the year to a pace close to the elevated fourth-quarter rate. Single-family starts edged down in May after declining substantially in April but were still at a relatively high level. While the cash-flow affordability of home ownership had fallen since late last year, it remained at favorable levels in comparison with recent years. Multifamily starts in May were at their highest level in more than three years; most of the pickup occurred in the South, where vacancy rates had declined recently. ']
