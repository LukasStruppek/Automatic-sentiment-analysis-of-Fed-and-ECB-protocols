[" Market interest rates on instruments with more than three-month maturities moved lower immediately following the announcement of the Committee's action, although some very short-term interest rates moved up. The commercial bank prime rate also was raised by 1/2 percentage point, to 7-1/4 percent. Market participants apparently interpreted the policy actions and the accompanying announcement as signaling that the System would not take further tightening actions as soon as they had anticipated earlier. Incoming data suggesting sluggish spending and subdued inflation tended to confirm these market assessments. Late in the intermeeting period, however, bond yields retraced these declines, partly in association with a weakening dollar in foreign exchange markets and rising commodity prices. Most major indexes of equity prices rose early in the intermeeting period, but they then moved lower in sympathy with the declines in bond prices and the dollar and ended the period with small losses.
