[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity recorded another substantial gain in the second quarter, causing levels of resource utilization to rise further. Increases in nonfarm payroll employment have been relatively large on average in recent months; the civilian unemployment rate is reported to have declined to 6.0 percent in May. The rise in industrial production slackened in April and May, primarily because capacity constraints prevented normal seasonal increases in the production of motor vehicles. Growth in consumer spending has slowed in recent months after very large increases in February and March. Housing starts have rebounded from winter disruptions to a pace close to the elevated fourth-quarter level. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong uptrend in spending on business equipment, while nonresidential construction has recovered from a weather-depressed level in the first quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was larger in April than in March but about unchanged from the average for the first quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices have remained moderate in recent months, though prices of many basic industrial materials have risen. ']
