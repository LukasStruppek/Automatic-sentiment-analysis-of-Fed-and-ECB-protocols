[' Business inventories increased in April, more than reversing a March runoff; the overall pace of accumulation remained moderate, and buildups were largely concentrated in segments of the economy where market demand was robust. In manufacturing, inventories increased in April and May after a small drawdown in March. The rise in stocks was in line with shipments, and the ratio of stocks to shipments stayed at a very low level. In April (latest available data), wholesale inventories retraced most of the sizable March drawdown. The ratio of inventories to sales in this sector remained below the range that has prevailed in recent years. At the retail level, inventory stocks again edged higher; the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector was well within the range observed over the past year. ']
