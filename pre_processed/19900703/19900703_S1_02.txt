Short-term interest rates have changed little on balance since the Committee meeting on May 15, while rates in long-term debt markets have declined somewhat over the intermeeting period. The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies.was somewhat higher over much of the period but declined late in the period to a level slightly below that prevailing at the time of the May meeting. M2 and M3 declined in May; available data for June suggest a partial rebound in M2 and little change in M3. Growth of M2 and especially of M3 has been damped by the continuing contraction of deposits of thrift institutions resulting from the restructuring of the thrift industry. Through June, expansion of M2 was estimated to be in the lower portion of its range for 1990 and growth of M3 somewhat below its range for the year. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have been at the midpoint of its monitoring range.
