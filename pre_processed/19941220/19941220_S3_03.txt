[' In their comments on developments in key sectors of the economy, members noted that consumer spending had increased briskly in recent months amid indications of favorable consumer sentiment that in turn undoubtedly reflected the rapid growth in employment and income. It was still too early to form reliable estimates of retail sales in the current holiday season. The anecdotal reports pointed to seasonal increases ranging from moderate to strong in various regions, but some members emphasized that sales volumes were being buttressed by unusual promotional efforts, including relatively large discounts. Some members also commented that consumer debt was growing rapidly and that increased debt levels were likely to exert a retarding effect on consumer spending, especially if consumer loan rates were to be adjusted more fully upward to reflect increases in market interest rates. Rates on adjustable home mortgages were moving higher to catch up with market rates and these increases along with the wealth effects from losses suffered on bond and stock holdings were likely to damp spending. Up to now, however, the members saw few signs of any moderation in the growth of consumer spending, including little apparent effect from somewhat higher interest rates on normally interest-sensitive spending for motor vehicles and other consumer durables.
