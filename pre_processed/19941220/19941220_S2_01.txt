[" The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth of economic activity would slow markedly over the next few quarters and then would average less than the rate of increase in the economy's potential output over the remainder of the forecast horizon. In the staff's judgment, the economy currently was operating beyond its long-run noninflationary capacity, and the forecast assumed that monetary policy would not accommodate any continuing tendency for aggregate demand to expand at a pace that could foster sustained higher inflation. Growth of consumer spending was expected to decline substantially in response to slower income growth, higher borrowing costs, and reductions in household net worth associated with lower asset values. Business outlays for new equipment were projected to be damped considerably by slower growth in sales, higher financing costs, and declining profits. Homebuilding also was expected to soften in response to higher financing costs, but the relatively favorable cash-flow affordability of housing was anticipated to act as a partial offset to those increased costs. The projected robust pace of economic activity abroad was expected to bolster export demand. With the economy having exceeded its noninflationary potential in the staff's judgment, wage and price inflation was projected to pick up for a period before turning down as pressures on productive resources eased.
