[" At a meeting conducted via a telephone conference on December 30, 1994, the Committee approved a temporary increase from $3 billion to $4-1/2 billion in the System's reciprocal currency (swap) agreement with the Bank of Mexico; it was understood that all drawings, including those under the permanent tranche of the System's swap agreement with the Bank of Mexico, would be subject to a determination that appropriate terms and conditions had been met. The U.S. Treasury also increased its swap facility with the Bank of Mexico by $1-1/2 billion to $4-1/2 billion, thereby raising the total for official U.S. facilities to $9.0 billion. The increases were in response to recent financial developments in Mexico. The Committee was informed at this meeting that the Bank of Canada would be considering an increase in its own CAN $1.0 billion facility with the Bank of Mexico, and that additional official financing assistance was being negotiated with the other G-10 central banks and the Bank of Spain.
