[" The other members who favored an unchanged policy preferred a symmetric directive. In their view, the information that would be released in the weeks immediately ahead was not likely to depart sufficiently from current expectations to warrant a policy tightening move during the intermeeting period. Moreover, current forecasts were subject to some risks in both directions. Those in the direction of appreciably greater-than-projected slowing in the expansion might have a relatively low probability, at least over the quarters immediately ahead, but that risk could not be ruled out and argued for a cautious approach to any further tightening. Accordingly, the Committee should wait until the next scheduled meeting when more information, possibly including a better assessment of the outlook for fiscal policy, would be available for evaluating the need for any further firming of monetary policy. One member expressed the view that it would be desirable to make any further short-run policy moves in the context of the Committee's long-run strategy to be considered at the next meeting. Despite their preferences, these members said that they would not dissent from an asymmetric directive. "]
