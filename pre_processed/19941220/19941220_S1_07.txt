[' Retail sales continued to rise rapidly in November. Sales were up solidly at most types of stores, but gains were particularly large at durable goods outlets. Consumer spending on services also had grown significantly in October (latest data), with advances widespread among categories of services. Housing starts increased appreciably in November, when construction activity apparently was boosted by favorable weather in some parts of the country. Multifamily starts rose in November to their highest level in four years, while single-family starts retraced a large part of their October decline. ']
