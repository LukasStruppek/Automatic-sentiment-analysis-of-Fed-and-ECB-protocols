[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, a majority of the members agreed on the desirability of maintaining an unchanged policy posture at least through the beginning of 1995. Monetary policy had been tightened considerably in a series of steps starting in February, and much of the restraint stemming from those policy moves had not yet been felt in the economy. This was especially true with regard to the effects of the latest policy moves in August and November, which accounted for half the total tightening. In the circumstances, a pause seemed warranted to give the Committee more time to assess the underlying strength of the economy and the impact of previous monetary restraint. This would provide a firmer basis for gauging the appropriate scope and timing of any further monetary restraint that might be needed to contain inflation. The level of real short-term interest rates, which had risen considerably this year and were now significantly positive, the uniformly sluggish behavior of the monetary aggregates, and the recent appreciation of the dollar might indicate that policy was now better positioned to restrain incipient inflation. It was noted that the Committee might have gained some leeway to maintain an unchanged policy without adverse expectational effects in light of the relatively large policy tightening implemented just a few weeks ago and the publication of favorable price and wage data that probably had alleviated, at least temporarily, concerns about future inflation. A number of members also commented that financial markets might tend to be a bit unsettled over the balance of the year as a result of the expected year-end adjustments along with the uncertainty about the effects and incidence of the sizable market losses incurred by some investors in 1994. In these circumstances, where there did not appear to be an urgent need for a further policy move, a number of members viewed conditions in financial markets as arguing for a steady policy course pending a reassessment early next year.
