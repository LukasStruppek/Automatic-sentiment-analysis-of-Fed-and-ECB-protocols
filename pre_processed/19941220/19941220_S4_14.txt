[" Mr. Broaddus dissented because he continued to question the desirability of the System's foreign exchange market intervention and therefore the desirability of maintaining or enlarging the swap arrangements that facilitate them. In his view continued System participation in such operations with the U.S. Treasury presented an unacceptable risk of reducing the System's credibility and its ability to conduct monetary policy effectively. He felt this risk was particularly high in this instance. Moreover, as at the March 22, 1994, meeting of the Committee, he had serious concerns about the appropriateness of the foreign exchange operations this particular enlargement would support. In his view, the expansion of this arrangement was equivalent in many respects to a fiscal policy initiative of a kind that should be explicitly authorized by the Congress. "]
