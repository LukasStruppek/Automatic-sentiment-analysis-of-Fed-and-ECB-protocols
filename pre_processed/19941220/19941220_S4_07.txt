[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a further pickup in economic growth in recent months. Nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in November, and the civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.6 percent. Industrial production registered another large increase in November and capacity utilization moved up further from already high levels. Retail sales have continued to rise rapidly. Housing starts increased appreciably in November. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong expansion in spending on business equipment; permits for nonresidential construction have been trending higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened somewhat in October from its average rate in the third quarter. Prices of many materials have continued to move up rapidly, but broad indexes of prices for consumer goods and services have increased moderately on average over recent months. ']
