[' Despite the evidence of vigorous expansion in overall economic activity and very high levels of resource use, broad measures of inflation in markets for finished goods and overall wage inflation had been on the low side of expectations recently. Anecdotal reports continued to point to very strong competition in most markets for final goods, and business firms continued to encounter widespread resistance in their efforts to increase prices as the costs of their raw materials and other inputs moved higher. Likewise, no uptrend currently was discernible in broad measures of wages even though labor markets were widely described as tight and labor shortages appeared to have increased further recently in some parts of the country. While examples of upward pressures on wages could be found in a number of industries, such as construction where there were pronounced shortages of skilled labor in many local areas, most business firms were strongly resisting sizable increases in their wages and were making use of "hiring bonuses" and "performance bonuses" instead of permanently higher wages to attract or retain workers. At the same time, job insecurities, including the potential loss of health and pension benefits, appeared to be holding down labor mobility and demands for higher compensation. However, many members commented that rising pressures on capacity, should they persist or intensify, could be expected to foster greater inflation at some point. Indeed, there were numerous reports of business plans to raise prices early in the new year, and a number of members commented that inflation probably would worsen somewhat over the near term. The subsequent behavior of prices and wages would depend importantly on fiscal and monetary policy developments, the extent of inflationary expectations among businesses and consumers, and the degree of pressure that further economic expansion would exert on capacity in various industries and occupations. Given their projections of some moderation in the business expansion and assuming appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, the members generally felt that any added inflation emerging in 1995 would likely be mild and could subside gradually during the year.
