[' Short-term interest rates rose considerably over the period after the November meeting. These rates had increased before the meeting in anticipation of a policy tightening move, but the size of the move was larger than expected and rates firmed a little further as a result. Over the remainder of the intermeeting interval, short-term rates responded to incoming economic data, for a time rising in reaction to indications of continuing strength in economic activity and later retracing a portion of these increases in response to favorable news on inflation. Rates on private money-market instruments with very short maturities also were lifted somewhat in anticipation of the usual year-end pressures. Long-term rates declined slightly over the intermeeting period. The more favorable inflation data, together with the relatively aggressive tightening action, apparently were viewed by many market participants as indicating that monetary policy would be sufficiently firm to hold inflation in check. The revelations in early December of financial difficulties in Orange County, California and concerns about their potential spread had a disruptive effect on financial markets, notably those for municipal securities, but aside from the securities of the affected communities, the disruption generally was brief. Most major indexes of equity prices fell, on balance, over the intermeeting period. ']
