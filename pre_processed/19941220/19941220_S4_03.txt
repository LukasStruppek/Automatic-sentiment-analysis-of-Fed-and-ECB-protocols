[' On the issue of possible adjustments to policy during the period until the next meeting, a majority of the members expressed a preference for an asymmetric directive tilted toward restraint. While most of these members preferred not to tighten policy at this point, they believed that the need for further monetary restraint was highly likely, though it would remain contingent on the tenor of the new information, including data on holiday retail sales, that would begin to arrive shortly after the turn of the year. Should the need for more restraint become apparent, it would be desirable in this view for the appropriate policy move to be made promptly to arrest any worsening of inflation and inflationary expectations, thereby minimizing the cumulative policy tightening that would be required and the ultimate cost of bringing inflation under control. The Committee always had the option of adjusting its policy during intermeeting periods even under a symmetric directive, but the balance of risks in the outlook argued in the view of these members for a policy reaction to new information that was best characterized by an asymmetric directive.
