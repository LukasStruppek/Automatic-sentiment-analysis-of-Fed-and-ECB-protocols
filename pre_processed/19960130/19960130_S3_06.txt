[" Further increases in business fixed investment were viewed as a likely prospect for the year ahead, though the growth of such investment probably would be well below the strong pace experienced earlier in the current cyclical expansion. Anecdotal reports indicated continuing strength in nonresidential construction in some parts of the country, but declining rates of capacity utilization augured reduced growth going forward. The expansion of investment in producers' durable equipment also was expected to slow, but from a pace that had seemed unsustainable. While appreciable further growth could be expected in expenditures for high-tech equipment as business firms continued to focus on improving the efficiency of their operations in a highly competitive environment, spending for other types of equipment was likely to be sluggish. Members noted in particular the prospects for weaker business spending for motor vehicles, especially for heavy trucks. However, the fundamental determinants of investment in business equipment, including the reduced cost of financing such investment, remained positive and this sector of the economy should continue to provide considerable impetus to the expansion.
