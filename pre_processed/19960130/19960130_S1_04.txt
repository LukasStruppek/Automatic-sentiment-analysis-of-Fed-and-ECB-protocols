['Only a limited amount of new information was available for this meeting because of delays in government releases; that which was available, along with anecdotal commentary, suggested that the economy had been growing relatively slowly in recent months. Consumer spending had expanded modestly on balance, growth in business invest- ment in capital goods appeared to have slackened somewhat recently, and housing demand seemed to have leveled out. Slower growth in final sales was leading to inventory buildups in a few industries and these buildups, together with the disruptions from government shutdowns and severe weather, were having a restraining effect on economic activity. The demand for labor was still growing at a moderate pace, though, and the unemployment rate remained relatively low. The recent data on prices and wages had been mixed, but there was no firm evidence of a change in underlying inflation trends. ']
