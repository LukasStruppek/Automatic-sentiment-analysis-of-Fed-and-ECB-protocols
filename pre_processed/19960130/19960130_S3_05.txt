[' With regard to consumer spending, members referred to overall indications of lackluster retail sales during the holiday season and into January. The anecdotal commentary on retail sales attributed some of the recent weakness in a number of areas to the clearly temporary effects of unusually severe winter weather and the partial shutdown of the federal government. The members anticipated that moderate growth in retail sales would resume, though some felt that the consumer sector might remain vulnerable on the downside. The consumer spending outlook was complicated by a number of crosscurrents. Negative factors cited by the members included ongoing concerns about job security that were being sustained by a continuing stream of workforce reduction announcements by major business concerns, increased consumer debt burdens that were showing up in rising delinquency rates on some types of loans, and the apparent satisfaction of much of the earlier pent-up demand for consumer durables. On the positive side, reduced interest rates, still readily available credit, and the accumulation of financial wealth from the sharp rise in stock and bond prices were seen as likely to support continuing gains in consumer spending.
