[" Most members endorsed a proposal to adopt the relatively low ranges for growth of M2 and M3 in 1996 that the Committee had set on a tentative basis in July 1995. These members favored retention of the tentative ranges because they could be viewed as benchmarks for money growth that would be associated with price stability, assuming behavior of velocity in line with historical experience, and a reaffirmation of those ranges would underscore the Committee's commitment to a policy of achieving price stability over the longer term. Some members also noted that any adjustment of these ranges to align them more fully with projections of money growth consistent with the Committee's expectations for expansion of the economy and prices in 1996 could be misinterpreted. Such an action might be seen as suggesting that the Committee had a greater degree of confidence in the relationship between money growth and broad measures of economic performance than was warranted by its current understanding of that relationship or that the Committee was now placing greater emphasis on the broad monetary aggregates as a gauge of the thrust of monetary policy.
