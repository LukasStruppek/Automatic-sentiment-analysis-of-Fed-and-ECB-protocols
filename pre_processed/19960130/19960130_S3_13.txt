[" Two members favored somewhat higher growth ranges for M2 and M3 in 1996. They noted that the expansion of these broad aggregates was anticipated to be around the upper ends of their tentative ranges, and perhaps even higher, given the Committee's expectations for the performance of the economy and prices. In their view, the higher ranges would be more consistent with what they saw as the Committee's obligations under the Federal Reserve Act to set ranges consistent with expected or desired economic outcomes for the year, and the reasons for establishing those ranges could easily be set forth and understood as an appropriate technical adjustment that would not imply any lessened commitment to the Committee's price stability goal.
