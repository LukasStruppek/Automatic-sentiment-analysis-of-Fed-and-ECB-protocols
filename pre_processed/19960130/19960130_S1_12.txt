[" At its meeting on December 19, 1995, the Committee adopted a directive that called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure on reserve positions, which was expected to result in a decline in the federal funds rate from around 5-3/4 percent to around 5-1/2 percent. The directive did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months. "]
