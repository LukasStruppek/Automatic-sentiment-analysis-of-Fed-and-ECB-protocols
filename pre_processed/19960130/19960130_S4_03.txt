[' The Chairman informed the Committee that he had asked the members of the Board of Governors to convene immediately after this meeting to consider a reduction of 1/4 percentage point in the discount rate. Such a reduction had been proposed by a total of six Federal Reserve Banks at this point. Given the easing in reserve markets favored by the Committee and the possibility of a lower discount rate, the members did not believe that a further policy move was likely to be needed during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, they favored an unbiased directive that did not incorporate a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the next several weeks. In keeping with its usual practice, the Committee did not rule out the possibility of an intermeeting policy change on the basis of unanticipated economic or financial developments. ']
