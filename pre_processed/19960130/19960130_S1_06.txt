[' Industrial production edged up in December and for the fourth quarter as a whole advanced only slightly; industrial activity remained sluggish in January according to the limited statistical information that was available. In December, manufacturing output rose a bit in association with an increase in motor vehicle assemblies and aircraft production. Elsewhere in manufacturing, the growth of output of office and computing equipment slowed somewhat from the rapid pace of previous months, and the production of defense and space equipment and of nondurable consumer goods registered sizable declines. The output of utilities was boosted somewhat in December by the effect of colder-than-average temperatures on the demand for heating services. Utilization of total industrial capacity fell slightly but remained at a moderately elevated level. ']
