[' At the conclusion of the Committees discussion, all the members supported a directive that called for a slight reduction in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a bias about the likely direction of an adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period, should unanticipated developments warrant a change in policy. Accordingly, the Committee decided that in the context of its long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months. ']
