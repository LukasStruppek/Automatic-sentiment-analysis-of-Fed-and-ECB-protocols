[' Recent data suggested little change in underlying inflation trends. Consumer prices increased slightly in December after being unchanged in November; food prices were quiescent over the two-month period while energy prices rose on balance, with a December rebound more than offsetting a sizable November drop. Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices were up modestly over the November- December period and for all of 1995 advanced slightly more than in 1994. Producer prices of finished goods were up considerably in November and December after having risen slowly in earlier months; in large part, the price increases late in the year reflected sharp upward movements in both finished foods and finished energy prices. For 1995, producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy rose at a subdued pace, though somewhat more than in 1994. Commodity prices had been mixed recently after trending down earlier. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers increased somewhat in December after having been unchanged in November. Increases in average hourly earnings had been trending up over the past several years. ']
