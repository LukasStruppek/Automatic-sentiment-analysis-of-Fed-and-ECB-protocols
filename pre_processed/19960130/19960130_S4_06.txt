[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the economy has been growing rather slowly in recent months. Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand moderately in December, and the civilian unemployment rate remained at 5.6 percent. Industrial production increased only slightly further in the fourth quarter. Growth of consumer spending was modest, on balance, over the past several months. Housing starts rebounded in November from a sizable October decline. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a moderation in the expansion of spending on business equipment, and nonresidential construction has risen appreciably further. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed in October from its average rate in the third quarter. There has been no clear change in underlying inflation trends. ']
