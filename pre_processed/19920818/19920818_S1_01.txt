Manufacturing output was unchanged in July, but overall industrial production was boosted by a higher level of mining and utility output. Retail sales increased moderately in July. Permits issued for the con struction of new housing units rose slightly in July, but housing starts fell. Recent data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods indicate further increases in outlays for business equipment, while nonresidential construction has remained soft. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in April-May was substantially above its average rate in the first quarter. Incoming data on wages and prices suggest that inflation is slowing. Interest rates have declined considerably since the Committee meeting on June 30-July 1. The Board of Governors approved a reduction in the discount rate from 3-1/2 to 3 percent on July 2. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined further over the first several weeks of the intermeeting period, but it has stabilized more recently. M2 and M3 contracted somewhat further in July. Through July, both aggregates were appreciably below the lower ends of the ranges established by the Committee for the year.
