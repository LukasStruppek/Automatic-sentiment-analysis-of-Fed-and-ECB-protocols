[' In the Committees discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, nearly all the members indicated that they could support an unchanged policy stance and the retention of a bias toward restraint in the directive. The members generally agreed that while the risks were greater that price inflation would rise than that it would fall, higher inflation was not a foregone conclusion and most believed that the uncertainties in the outlook made it prudent to hold monetary policy on a steady course and await further developments. The expansion appeared to be slowing substantially and broad measures of prices, adjusted for fluctuations in their food and energy components, still indicated a steady or even slightly declining inflation trend. In these circumstances, the Committee could wait for more information on the momentum of the expansion and the degree of pressure on resources and its implications for inflation. A delay in adjusting monetary policy was facilitated by its current positioning, which did not appear to be far from a desirable longer-term stance because any pickup in inflation was likely to be relatively small and gradual, and was further supported by the possibility of an excessive reaction in financial markets to a change in the direction of policy. A few members indicated that they could vote for some slight tightening in policy, although they did not feel any urgency about such a move. They observed that the decision was a close one for them, and in light of the uncertainties that were involved, they were willing to join the majority and wait for further evidence bearing on the outlook for inflation. With regard to possible intermeeting adjustments to policy, the members agreed that retaining an asymmetric directive that was biased toward restraint would be consistent with their assessments of the inflation risks in the economy. Accordingly, information suggesting that the odds on higher inflation had risen should be met with a prompt policy firming. ']
