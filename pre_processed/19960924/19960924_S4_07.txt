[' The Committee also reviewed, on a preliminary basis, its current practices with regard to the maturity structure of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio of Treasury obligations. In its last such review, at its meeting on March 31, 1992, the Committee decided that the enhanced liquidity of the SOMA portfolio that had been achieved should be maintained but that net additions to System holdings should continue to be spread across all maturity areas. In the course of their discussion at this meeting, the members agreed that the primary objective in the management of the SOMA portfolio was to ensure a high degree of liquidity so that prompt and effective adjustments could be made without unduly affecting the market for Treasury securities.
