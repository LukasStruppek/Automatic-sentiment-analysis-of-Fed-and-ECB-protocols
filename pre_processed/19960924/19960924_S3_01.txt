[' In the Committees discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the incoming information had been mixed since the August meeting but that on the whole it continued to suggest appreciable slowing in the economic expansion from a rapid and unsustainable pace in the second quarter. Data for many components of final demand, notably in the consumer sector, indicated that economic growth had moderated considerably in recent months. At the same time, supply-side data including employment and industrial production had remained relatively robust, contributing to uncertainty about underlying growth and suggesting that inventory accumulation had picked up during the summer. While the extent of the slowing in the overall expansion remained unclear, there were no indications of serious imbalances in the economy, and the members generally viewed further growth at a pace near that of the economys potential as a likely prospect. They continued to be concerned, however, about the outlook for inflation, given the high level of production. In that regard, some commented that labor markets appeared to have tightened further in recent months and that wages were rising at a somewhat faster pace. Even so, the rate of price inflation had not picked up and the prospects were good that inflation would remain contained for some time. Whether the factors that had contributed to such a price performance would persist remained a key uncertainty in the economic outlook, and the members generally agreed that the risks continued to be tilted to some extent in the direction of rising price inflation over the forecast horizon.
