Private nonfarm payroll employment grew less rapidly over July and August than in the second quarter, while the civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.1 percent in August. Industrial production increased somewhat less rapidly on average in July and August than in the prior few months. Total retail sales rose slightly over July and August after having declined substantially in June. Housing starts in July and August were unchanged on average from their second-quarter level. Demand for business equipment has remained strong, while spending on nonresidential structures has changed little on balance in recent months. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in July from its average in the second quarter. Increases in labor compensation have been somewhat larger this year, but consumer price inflation, excluding its food and energy components, has edged lower. ']
