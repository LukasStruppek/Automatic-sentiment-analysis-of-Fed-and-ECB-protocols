[' Industrial production picked up in April and May after changing little in the first quarter, but the strike at General Motors likely depressed industrial production substantially in June. In manufacturing, the output of motor vehicles rose briskly on balance over April and May, and the production of computers and office equipment remained robust. Growth in the manufacture of materials slowed sharply, perhaps reflecting the effects of reduced exports to Asia. Output of utilities, which continued to fluctuate widely, changed little on balance over the April-May period. The rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity edged down in May to its lowest level in more than two years as capacity grew at a faster rate than output. ']
