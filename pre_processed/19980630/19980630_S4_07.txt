[' Most short-term interest rates have changed little since the meeting on May 19, but longer-term rates have declined somewhat. Share prices in U.S. equity markets remained volatile and changes in major indexes were mixed on balance over the intermeeting period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar rose sharply through mid-June in terms of other major currencies, declined more recently, but is up somewhat on net since the May meeting; the fluctuations in the average value of the dollar in terms of these major currencies were largely related to movements against the Japanese yen. The dollar has risen further against the currencies of key emerging market economies, particularly some of those in Asia. ']
