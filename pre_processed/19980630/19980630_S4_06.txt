[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity has slowed considerably after a very rapid advance in the first quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment registered another substantial increase in May, and the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.3 percent. Industrial output picked up in recent months after weakening early this year; however, a strike at General Motors likely depressed output substantially in June. Although retail sales posted large gains in April and May, overall consumer spending appears to have grown less rapidly in the second quarter than in the first. Residential sales have remained exceptionally strong, but housing starts and building permits slipped back in the spring, on a seasonally adjusted basis, from a sharply increased first-quarter level. Available indicators suggest that growth of business fixed investment also is slowing after a surge earlier in the year. Business inventory accumulation appears to have moderated in April from an extraordinarily rapid rate in the first quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services continued to widen in April. Developments in the food and energy sectors contributed to a slightly faster advance in consumer prices in May. ']
