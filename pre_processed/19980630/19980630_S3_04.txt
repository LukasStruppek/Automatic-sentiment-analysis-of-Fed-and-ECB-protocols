[' Business fixed investment remained on a strong uptrend, buoyed by several favorable factors. The latter included the ready availability of debt and equity financing on relatively attractive terms, and opportunities to invest in high-tech equipment at lower prices to enhance productivity and hold down labor costs in a period of very tight labor markets. While these factors were expected to continue to support appreciable further expansion in business investment, growth in demand for capital goods was likely to diminish as a result of the projected slowing in the expansion of final sales and business profits and the absence of pressure on manufacturing capacity. With regard to the outlook for nonresidential construction, members reported that declining vacancy rates and rising prices and rents of office buildings and to some extent other commercial structures were fostering very high levels of construction activity in several areas. Moreover, there were indications that some construction projects were being delayed because of scarcities of labor or construction materials. A number of members commented that some of the construction was being undertaken on a speculative basis and that the strong pace of building activity pointed to overbuilding in some areas. On the residential side, construction activity also displayed considerable strength across much of the country. There were widespread anecdotal and other reports of high levels of home sales and few reports of faltering housing demand. Favorable factors undergirding current housing activity, including the robust growth in employment and incomes, high wealth-to-income ratios, and very attractive terms on home mortgages, seemed likely to continue to hold housing construction close to current elevated levels.
