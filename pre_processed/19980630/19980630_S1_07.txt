[' Total nominal retail sales posted large gains in April and May. Sales were strong at automotive dealers in response to a sharp increase in incentives offered by the Big Three automakers. Sales also rose briskly at building material and supply outlets and at general merchandise, apparel, and furniture and appliance stores. Although the growth in real outlays for services in April (latest data available) was held down by a small decline in purchases of energy services, the expansion of outlays for non-energy services remained brisk. Sales of homes were very strong in April and May, but housing starts and building permits declined slightly on a seasonally adjusted basis from their elevated first-quarter rates. ']
