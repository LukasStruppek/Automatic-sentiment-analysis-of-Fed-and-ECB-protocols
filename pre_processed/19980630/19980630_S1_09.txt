[' Business inventory investment slowed sharply in April from the extraordinarily rapid rate of accumulation in the first quarter. In manufacturing, stockbuilding picked up somewhat in April from the first-quarter pace, but with sales also rising, the stock-sales ratio remained at a very low level. Wholesale inventories declined sharply in April, primarily reflecting runoffs in stocks of motor vehicles; the inventory-sales ratio for the sector remained near the upper end of its range over the preceding twelve months. Retail inventory accumulation slowed somewhat in April, and the aggregate inventory- sales ratio stayed close to the lower end of its range over the past year. ']
