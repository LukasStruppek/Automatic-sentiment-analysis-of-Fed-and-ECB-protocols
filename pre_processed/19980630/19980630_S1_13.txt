[' Open market operations were directed throughout the intermeeting period toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, and the federal funds rate averaged close to the intended level of 5-1/2 percent. Market participants interpreted the further turmoil in financial markets in Asia and emerging market economies elsewhere as damping the outlook for U.S. economic growth and improving the chances that inflation would remain low. While most short-term interest rates changed little on balance over the period, yields on longer-term Treasury securities, and to a lesser extent on private debt instruments, declined somewhat, at least partly reflecting a further flight to safety and quality from renewed turbulence in a number of foreign markets. Share prices in U.S. equity markets remained volatile, and changes in major indexes were mixed on balance over the intermeeting period. ']
