[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the expansion in economic activity had slowed considerably after a very rapid advance in the first quarter. Much of the slowdown reflected a substantial moderation in business inventory accumulation. Consumer spending, business investment, and residential homebuilding, though remaining robust, apparently also were decelerating somewhat after very strong gains in the first quarter; and the erosion in net exports continued to damp demand for domestically produced goods. Payroll employment persisted on a brisk uptrend, but industrial production seemed likely to record only modest further expansion in the second quarter. Labor markets remained tight, and there were indications of some further acceleration in employment costs. Recent data on consumer prices were a little less favorable than they had been earlier in the year. ']
