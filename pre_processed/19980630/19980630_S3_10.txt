[" In their discussion of the choice of ranges for growth of M2 and M3 in 1998 and 1999, the members agreed that those ranges should not reflect forecasts of money growth under anticipated economic and financial conditions, but instead should be viewed as anchors or benchmarks for money growth that would be associated with price stability and sustained economic growth, assuming behavior of velocity in line with historical experience. Reaffirming the current ranges for 1998 and extending them to 1999 would thus underscore the Committee's commitment to a policy of achieving price stability over time. In the view of a few members, the Committee should consider adopting ranges centered on its expectations for growth of the monetary aggregates in the future, but only if the members became more confident about the relationship between the growth of money and measures of aggregate economic performance and undertook to give more weight to the growth of the broad monetary aggregates in setting monetary policy. Some members noted that retention of the current monetary ranges oriented toward price stability did not preclude greater use of the aggregates in assessing overall financial conditions and the formulation of monetary policy. The Committee agreed that the current range for nonfinancial debt for 1998 should be left unchanged and that the same range should be extended to 1999. The current range readily encompassed the growth rate seen likely to be associated with the members' forecasts for economic activity and prices. "]
