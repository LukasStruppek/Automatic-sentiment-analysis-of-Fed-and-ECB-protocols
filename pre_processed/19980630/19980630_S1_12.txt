[" At its meeting on May 19, 1998, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that would be consistent with the federal funds rate continuing to average around 5-1/2 percent. In light of concerns that growth in aggregate demand might remain so strong relative to the expansion of the economy's potential that inflationary pressures would tend to be generated, the Committee chose to retain an asymmetric directive tilted toward a possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds rate. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with considerable moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over the months ahead. "]
