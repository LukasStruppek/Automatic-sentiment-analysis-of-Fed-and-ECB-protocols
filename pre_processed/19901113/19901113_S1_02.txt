Most interest rates have fallen somewhat since the Committee meeting on October 2. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has declined considerably further over the intermeeting period. In October, M2 grew only slightly after two months of relatively rapid expansion, while M3 was about unchanged. Through October, expansion of M2 was estimated to be somewhat below the middle of the Committee's range for the year and growth of M3 near the lower end of its range. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have been near the midpoint of its monitoring range.
