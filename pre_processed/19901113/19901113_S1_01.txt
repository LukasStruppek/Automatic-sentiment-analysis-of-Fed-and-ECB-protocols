The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a weakening in economic activity. Total nonfarm payroll employment declined further in October, reflecting sizable job losses in manufacturing and construction; the civilian unemployment rate held steady at 5.7 percent. Industrial production declined sharply in October after rising moderately during the summer. Consumer spending is estimated to have flattened out in real terms over August and September when a surge in energy prices caused a substantial drop in real disposable income. Advance indicators of business capital spending point to considerable softening in investment in coming months. Residential construction weakened further in the third quarter. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened substantially in July-August from its average rate in the second quarter as imports strengthened. Markedly higher oil prices have boosted consumer and producer prices in recent months. The latest data on labor costs suggest some slight improvement from earlier trends.
