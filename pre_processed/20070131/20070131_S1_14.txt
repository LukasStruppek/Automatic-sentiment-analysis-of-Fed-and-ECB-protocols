Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors was estimated to have expanded in the fourth quarter at a pace that was close to that registered over the first three quarters of the year. A pickup in merger-related borrowing appeared to boost business debt growth last quarter, and a sharp rise in the issuance of bonds and commercial paper more than offset a moderation in bank loans. In the household sector, the ongoing deceleration in house prices further restrained the growth of home mortgage debt. M2 continued to expand briskly in December and January, primarily reflecting strength in its liquid deposit component.
