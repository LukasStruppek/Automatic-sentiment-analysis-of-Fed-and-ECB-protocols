The information reviewed at the January meeting, which included the advance data on the national income and product accounts for the fourth quarter, showed that economic expansion had picked up in the fourth quarter of 2006, but was uneven across sectors. Considerable vigor in consumer spending late last year boosted economic growth in the fourth quarter, supported by further increases in employment and income. A surge in net exports and a pickup in defense spending also raised output growth last quarter, but these factors were expected to prove largely transitory. The decline in residential construction continued to weigh on overall activity, but some indications of stabilization in the demand for homes had emerged. Outlays for business fixed investment softened in the fourth quarter. Although a spike in energy prices lifted total consumer price inflation in December, readings on core inflation had edged lower in recent months.
