After having risen at a solid average pace in the first three quarters of last year, real investment in equipment and software fell in the fourth quarter. Business outlays on transportation equipment, a volatile spending category, dropped considerably. Sales of light vehicles to business customers declined to their lowest level in two years, which more than offset a surge in sales of medium and heavy trucks ahead of stricter regulations on truck engine emissions that went into effect this year. Spending on high-tech capital goods moderated. Outside of the transportation and high-tech sectors, real spending declined last quarter. That weakness appeared to be concentrated in equipment related to construction and motor vehicle manufacturing. Nonresidential construction activity decelerated late last quarter; however, indicators of future expenditures in this sector remained firm, with office and industrial vacancy rates somewhat below their historical averages. Overall, prospects for business spending continued to be supported by robust corporate cash flow and a low cost of capital.
