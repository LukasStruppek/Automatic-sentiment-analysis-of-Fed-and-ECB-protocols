Industrial production picked up in February after a modest decline in January. That pattern was attributable to swings in utilities output, as temperatures were historically warm early in the year before reverting to near seasonal norms in February. Excluding utilities, industrial production posted a sizable gain in January before flattening out in February, pointing to a solid rise in the first quarter. Mining output--which includes oil and natural gas extraction--slipped in February after registering robust gains in each of the previous three months. Manufacturing output was unchanged in February after a significant increase in January. The rate of capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector stood a bit above its long-run average.
