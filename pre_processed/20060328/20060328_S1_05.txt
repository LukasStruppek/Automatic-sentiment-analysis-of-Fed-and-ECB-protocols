Consumer spending appeared to have rebounded strongly in the first quarter. Motor vehicle purchases bounced back in late 2005 and early 2006 from the sluggish pace that followed the end of the past summer's "employee pricing" programs. Excluding motor vehicles, consumption spending was robust, supported by continuing improvement in the labor market and advances in wage and salary income. The annual raise in the pay of federal employees, cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security benefits and other transfer programs, and the initiation of the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan boosted the level of personal disposable income in January. Consumption was likely supported also by ongoing increases in home prices and gains in the stock market. Consumer confidence as measured by surveys remained consistent with moderate increases in consumer spending.
