The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding strongly in the first quarter. Consumer spending was on track to rise at a robust pace, and business purchases of equipment and software picked up appreciably. Warm weather boosted housing construction in January and February, although sales of new homes dropped back and house prices decelerated slightly. Private payrolls advanced solidly in the first two months of the year. Headline consumer price inflation jumped in January but moderated in February as energy prices moved down. Core inflation remained contained.
