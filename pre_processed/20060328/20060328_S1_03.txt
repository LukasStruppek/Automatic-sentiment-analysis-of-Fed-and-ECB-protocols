Labor demand continued to increase in the first two months of 2006, as private nonfarm payroll employment showed large gains in both January and February. With favorable weather conditions, employment growth was especially brisk in the construction sector. Financial activities, business services, and nonbusiness services also posted solid payroll gains. Although the average workweek edged down in February, the level of aggregate hours for production and nonsupervisory workers was above its average for the fourth quarter of 2005. The unemployment rate continued to decline and averaged 4Å¾ percent over the first two months of the year. Several other labor market indicators also signaled a further tightening of labor market conditions.
