Real outlays for equipment and software decelerated in the fourth quarter of 2005 but appeared to have gained strength in early 2006. This pattern reflected sizable swings in outlays for transportation equipment. The fundamentals underlying capital spending continued to be supportive, as business sector output expanded briskly, firms remained flush with funds, and relative price declines for high-tech equipment continued to push down its user cost. Although vacancy rates for nonresidential properties were well below the peaks reached in the first quarter of 2004, real spending on new construction had yet to gain traction. In contrast, outlays for drilling and mining structures continued to rise rapidly and appeared poised to increase further in the near term.
