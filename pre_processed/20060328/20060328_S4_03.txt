The Committee also discussed its experience with the two-day meeting. Participants agreed that the additional time had facilitated their discussion of the economy, policy, and the wording of the announcement. It was agreed that, because of scheduling conflicts, the next meeting of the Committee would be held on one day, Wednesday, May 10, 2006. After experience with that and perhaps the subsequent meeting that is already scheduled for two days, a decision would be taken about the general format of future meetings.
