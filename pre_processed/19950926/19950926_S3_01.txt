[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the information available since the August meeting had tended to confirm earlier indications of a pickup in the expansion after a period of sluggish growth during the spring. The economy did not display uniform strength across industries or regions, but it appeared on balance to have considerable and desirable expansionary momentum. Growth at a pace averaging close to, or perhaps slightly below, the economy's potential was viewed as the most likely prospect for the year ahead. The outlook for economic activity remained subject to a variety of uncertainties, including the still unsettled course of the federal budget, and many members saw the risks of a shortfall from expectations as slightly greater than those of significantly faster growth. With regard to inflation, the slower increases in key measures of consumer and producer prices since earlier in the year were a welcome development, and a number of members commented that inflation was likely to remain contained, given likely developments. Many expressed concern, however, that significant further progress toward achieving stable prices might not be made over the next year or two. "]
