[' As in other recent months, consumer prices rose more slowly in August than in the early months of the year. Sizable declines in energy prices were a contributing factor, but price increases also had moderated for nonfood, non-energy items; the moderation largely reflected a downturn in automobile finance charges and used-car prices along with smaller increases in airline fares. For the twelve months ending in August, nonfood, non-energy prices rose by the same amount as in the year-earlier period. At the producer level, prices of finished goods edged lower in August after being unchanged in July. Although declines in prices of finished energy goods held down the overall index in both months, prices of finished goods other than food and energy rose more slowly than in the early months of the year; for the twelve months ending in August, nonfood, non-energy prices of finished goods increased slightly more than in the comparable year-earlier period.
