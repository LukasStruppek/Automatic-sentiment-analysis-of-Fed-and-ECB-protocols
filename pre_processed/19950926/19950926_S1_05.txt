[' Private nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably in August after changing little in July. Much of the rise reflected a pickup in hiring in the services industry, notably in business services. Manufacturing payrolls were up modestly in August; the gain followed substantial declines in the previous four months. Construction employment changed little on balance over July and August, with only small changes being posted each month. The civilian unemployment rate edged down to 5.6 percent in August, remaining in the narrow range that had prevailed since late 1994. ']
