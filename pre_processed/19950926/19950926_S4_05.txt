[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate rate in the current quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably in August after essentially no growth in July; the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 5.6 percent in August. Industrial production posted a large increase in August to a level moderately above the average of the second quarter. Total nominal retail sales rose slightly on balance over July and August after registering appreciable gains in the prior two months. Housing starts were up a little in August after increasing sharply in July. Orders for nondefense capital goods have softened but still point to substantial expansion of spending on business equipment over coming months; nonresidential construction has been strong of late. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened slightly in July from its average rate in the second quarter. After increasing at elevated rates in the early part of the year, consumer and producer prices have risen more slowly in recent months. ']
