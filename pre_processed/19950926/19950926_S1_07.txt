[" Retail sales were up slightly on balance over July and August after rising appreciably in the previous two months. Abstracting from the volatile sales of motor vehicles during this period, spending on goods changed little on balance over the two months, as increased outlays for durable goods were offset by flagging purchases of apparel. Spending on services rose in July (latest data available) owing in part to elevated demand for energy-related services during that month's unseasonably warm weather. Housing market activity increased further in July and August. Sales of both new and existing homes in July (latest data) reached their highest levels in more than a year, and housing starts edged up in August after a substantial rise in July. "]
