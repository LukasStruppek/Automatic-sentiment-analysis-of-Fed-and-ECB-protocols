[' A number of members commented that fiscal policy developments constituted a major uncertainty in the outlook for economic activity. While measures incorporating substantial reductions in spending from current trends were widely expected to be enacted into law, it was not possible to predict the outcome of the continuing debate on the federal budget in the Congress and the Administration. Further complicating any efforts to assess the potential damping influence of prospective fiscal policy were uncertainties regarding the time frame during which the new expenditure and tax measures would be put in place--including the extent to which they would be implemented over the year ahead--and the effects of the new fiscal measures on economic incentives and financial markets. Favorable business and financial market reactions would tend to mitigate, at least for a time, the restraining effects of fiscal measures on aggregate demand. On the other hand, if the deficit reduction measures that eventually were enacted were to fall substantially short of current expectations, there would be adverse repercussions in financial markets and possibly on business confidence.
