[' At this meeting, the Committee discussed a bill, titled the "Economic Growth and Price Stability Act of 1995," that recently had been introduced in the United States Senate. The bill would make price stability the primary long-run policy goal of the Federal Reserve and require the Federal Reserve to establish a numerical definition of price stability and to implement a policy that would effectively promote such stability over time. It would repeal the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the "Humphrey-Hawkins Act") and certain related provisions in the Employment Act of 1946 and the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The Federal Reserve had not yet been asked its views of the bill, but testimony was likely at some point and a preliminary discussion would help to identify important issues. ']
