[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged degree of pressure on reserve positions. The expansion seemed for now to have a desirable and sustainable momentum that did not call for any change in policy. Furthermore, the outlook remained clouded by the uncertainties stemming from the ongoing federal budget debate. In any event, the Committee would need to remain alert to a broader range of developments that might warrant a policy change at some point. In this connection, several members expressed the opinion that policy might have to be eased eventually in light of the downside risks that they saw in the economy and a current policy stance that they viewed as slightly restrictive. However, the current performance of the economy suggested that the timing of an easing action was not an immediate concern. Other members who preferred an unchanged policy placed more emphasis on current forecasts of little or no progress in reducing inflation from recent levels. They thought it would be premature to ease policy without greater assurance that inflation had been contained in the current cyclical expansion and that prospects for significant further progress toward the long-run objective of price level stability had improved. Indeed, the direction of the next policy move was not clear in the view of some members, and they believed that any easing should await a firm indication that the outlook for economic activity was becoming less favorable or that inflation was decreasing more rapidly than expected.
