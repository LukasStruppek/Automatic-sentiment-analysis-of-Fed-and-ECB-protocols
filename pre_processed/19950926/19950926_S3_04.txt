[' Housing demand was continuing to respond to more attractive mortgage rates, as evidenced by nationwide data and anecdotal reports from many parts of the country. Increases in construction activity were lagging the improvement in housing demand and had been limited thus far, but considerable strength in homebuilding activity could be expected over the next several months. The extent of further lagged responses to reduced mortgage rates could not be foreseen with any degree of certainty, and in any event housing demand would depend on broad economic developments such as trends in employment and income. Housing activity appeared to have weakened over recent months in one major market where economic conditions were described as relatively sluggish. In many other areas, however, persons in the real estate industry were reported to be optimistic about the outlook for housing. ']
