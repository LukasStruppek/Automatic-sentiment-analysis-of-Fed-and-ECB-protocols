[" The nation's trade deficit was expected to diminish somewhat over the next several quarters and in the process to exert less restraint on domestic economic activity. The better trade performance was projected to result from a number of factors, including the improved competitive position of U.S. producers and the lagged effects of earlier declines in the value of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. It also was associated with forecasts of somewhat stronger growth in economic activity abroad than in the United States. While there were continuing anecdotal reports of expanding export markets, some members expressed reservations about the extent to which the economies of major foreign trading partners would strengthen over the forecast period and the related prospects for growth of foreign demand for U.S. goods and services.
