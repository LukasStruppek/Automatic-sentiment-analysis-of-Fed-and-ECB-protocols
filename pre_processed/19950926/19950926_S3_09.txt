[' Views on the outlook for inflation centered on forecasts of little change or some slight decline in the rate of increase in consumer prices over the year ahead. The appreciable moderation in inflation in recent months had checked the deteriorating trend that seemed to be emerging during the early months of the year, but the members generally believed that recent developments did not point to a significant further decline in inflation. Pressures on producer resources had eased since the early part of the year, but the labor market remained tight and capacity utilization was still above its historical average. In this connection, a few members commented that current forecasts were subject to a range of error that included a risk of some intensification of inflationary pressures. ']
