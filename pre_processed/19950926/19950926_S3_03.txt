[' In their discussion of developments in key sectors of the economy, members generally viewed comparatively moderate growth in consumer spending as a likely prospect over the forecast period. After recording sizable gains in late spring, retail sales had been well maintained in recent months, with some strengthening in the motor vehicles sector in August apparently carrying over to September. Favorable factors in the outlook for consumer spending included the increases that had occurred in the value of financial assets and the demand for household appliances and other durables that was expected to be generated by stronger housing activity. On the other hand, overall gains in consumer spending were likely to be restrained by cyclically waning pent-up demands for consumer durables, especially motor vehicles; still widespread concerns about job security associated with ongoing business restructuring and downsizing activities; and higher consumer debt loads.
