[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding at a moderate rate in the current quarter. Consumer spending appeared to be advancing somewhat further after a sizable gain in the second quarter; housing demand had strengthened in response to earlier reductions in mortgage rates; and business investment remained on a solid uptrend. Although business efforts to pare inventories apparently were still in progress, both production and employment were advancing moderately. After having increased at elevated rates in the early part of the year, consumer and producer prices had risen more slowly in recent months. ']
