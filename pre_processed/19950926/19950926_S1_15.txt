[' After further strong expansion in August, M2 and M3 appeared to be growing at a somewhat more moderate rate in September. The still-brisk demand for M2 assets was associated with the lower market interest rates now prevailing and the related decline in the opportunity costs associated with holding these assets. The relatively robust growth of M3 reflected inflows to institution-only money market funds as well as bank acquisitions of wholesale funds to meet loan demand. For the year through August, M2 expanded at a rate somewhat below the upper end of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate appreciably above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had grown at a rate around the midpoint of its monitoring range in recent months. ']
