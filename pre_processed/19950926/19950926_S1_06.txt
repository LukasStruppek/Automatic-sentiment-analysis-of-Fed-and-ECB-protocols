[' Industrial production jumped in August to a level moderately above its average for the second quarter. Manufacturing output rose sharply, posting its first increase since January; a surge in the production of motor vehicles and parts accounted for some of the advance, but the output of non-automotive consumer goods in August more than reversed a sizable drop in July, and the production of business equipment recorded another robust gain. A steep rise in electricity generation associated with unusually hot weather over much of the country more than offset a decline in mining production. Total utilization of industrial capacity moved higher in August but remained below the average rate for the first quarter. ']
