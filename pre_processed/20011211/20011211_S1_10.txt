The book value of business inventories fell steeply in the third quarter. The bulk of the reduction occurred in the manufacturing sector, but the sharp drop in stocks was matched by a contraction in shipments and the aggregate stock-shipments ratio for the sector remained at a very high level. In October, an additional sizable decline in manufacturing stocks resulted in a decrease in the sector's aggregate stock-shipments ratio, though it remained elevated. Wholesalers also experienced a sizable drop in inventories in the third quarter that produced a slight reduction in their aggregate inventory-sales ratio, but the latter was still in the upper portion of its range for the past two years. Retail inventories and the sector's inventory-sales ratio both edged up in the third quarter. Nonetheless, the sector's ratio remained in the lower end of its range for the past year.
