Core consumer price inflation remained at a relatively subdued pace in September and October, and a renewed decline in energy prices in October contributed to a sizable drop in total consumer price inflation during the twelve months ended in October when compared with the previous twelve-month period. The core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) chain-type price index also indicated that consumer inflation was significantly lower during the year ended in October, while the core consumer price index (CPI), with its narrower range of spending categories, had changed little over the past year. Core producer prices for finished goods edged up on balance during September and October, but inflation as measured by this index moderated slightly on a year-over-year basis. With regard to labor costs, growth of average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers slowed in September and October from the relatively moderate rate that had prevailed in earlier months.
