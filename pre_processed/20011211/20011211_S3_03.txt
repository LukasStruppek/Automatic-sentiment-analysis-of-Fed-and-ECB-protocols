Like consumer spending, new home construction and sales had displayed considerable resilience in recent months, apparently in large part as a result of relatively attractive mortgage interest rates and perhaps to some extent as a consequence of favorable weather conditions in many parts of the country. Though overall housing activity remained at a high level, members reported softening activity in a few areas of the nation, notably in apartment units in some major cities. Sales of high-end houses also continued to be relatively depressed. With regard to the outlook, the recent rise in mortgage interest rates could be expected to have a retarding effect on housing activity. Even so, in the absence of seriously adverse shocks to confidence, housing activity seemed likely to hold near current levels over the quarters immediately ahead.
