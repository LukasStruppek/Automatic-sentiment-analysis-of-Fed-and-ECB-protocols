Recent information suggested that the downward trend in business spending on durable equipment and software might be moderating somewhat. After plunging during the spring and summer, orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods turned up in October. Of particular note, both orders and shipments of office and computing equipment increased in October after having declined sharply for most of the year. For durable equipment in general, shipments had exceeded new orders since the first of the year, and as a result the backlog of unfilled orders was now below its level of a year ago. Nonresidential construction also had been weak during the spring and summer, reflecting an upward trend in vacancy rates and uncertainties regarding rents and property values. Although spending on industrial structures dropped further in October, outlays for office buildings and other commercial structures picked up noticeably.
