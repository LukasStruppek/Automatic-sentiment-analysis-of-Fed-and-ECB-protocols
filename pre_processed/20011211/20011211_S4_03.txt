Given their views about the risks to the economy, the members supported the retention of the sentence in the press statement to be released shortly after this meeting indicating that the risks continued to be weighted mainly toward conditions that could foster economic weakness in the foreseeable future. Such a statement was not intended to convey the impression that the Committee necessarily contemplated further easing actions. Members felt that the reduced size of today's action along with a reference in the statement to the emergence of signs that weakness in the economy could be moderating would tend to mitigate such an interpretation.
