[' Many of the data for recent months reviewed at this meeting were influenced to an uncertain degree by unusually severe winter weather, industrial strikes, and U.S. government shutdowns. On balance, the expansion in economic activity appears to have picked up after slowing appreciably in late 1995. Nonfarm payroll employment surged in February, considerably more than offsetting a large drop in January, and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent. Manufacturing production increased sharply in February after a sizable decline in January. Growth of consumer spending, which had been sluggish earlier in the winter, spurted in February, paced by strong motor vehicle purchases. Housing starts rose in January and February. Orders and contracts point to continuing expansion of spending on business equipment and nonresidential structures. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed substantially in the fourth quarter from its average rate in the third quarter. There has been no clear change in underlying inflation trends. ']
