[' The economy had displayed considerable resilience in the face of adjustments to production associated with efforts by many business firms to reduce inventories and a number of additional, albeit temporary, developments that had tended to retard the expansion in the latter part of 1995 and at the start of this year. Apparently, relatively low long-term interest rates and the related substantial appreciation in the value of stock and bond market holdings had been important factors helping to sustain spending in this period. In the context of continued underlying momentum in final demand and some decline in excess stocks of unsold motor vehicles stemming from the recently ended strike at a major domestic producer, inventories now seemed to be in better balance with sales and the economy to be better positioned to accommodate sustained expansion. Some members observed, however, that the recent increase in intermediate- and long-term interest rates would tend to blunt demand in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. Moreover, stock market prices had risen to comparatively high levels in relation to earnings and interest rates and might be vulnerable to further weakness in the debt markets or to any tendency for business profit margins to erode.
