[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. This policy preference was based on expectations of growth in business activity at a pace averaging in the vicinity of the economy's potential, a perception among the members that the risks to such an outlook were more balanced than earlier, and anticipations that under these circumstances inflation would remain constrained. The economy seemed to have adequate forward momentum and did not appear to require any further stimulus, whose implementation might contribute to inflationary pressures in the economy. Several members observed that robust growth in broad money for some months suggested that monetary policy had been supportive of sustained economic expansion. At the same time, information on the economy and prices did not seem to indicate developing inflation pressures that needed to be contained by tightening policy at this juncture. Indeed, some members commented that, judged from one perspective, financial conditions had tightened somewhat as a consequence of the recent rise in intermediate- and long-term interest rates, though it was difficult to disentangle the real and the inflation components of the rate increases. Nonetheless, a number of members noted that inflation was not expected to moderate further over the projection horizon and that it could move higher and the Committee would need to be particularly vigilant in guarding against such an outcome. Against this background, the members favored an unbiased instruction in the directive that did not prejudice possible intermeeting adjustments to policy in either direction. "]
