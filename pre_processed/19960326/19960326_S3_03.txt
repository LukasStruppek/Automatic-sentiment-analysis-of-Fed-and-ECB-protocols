[' In the course of their comments about developments in key sectors of the economy, members referred to recent indications, including anecdotal reports, of appreciable strengthening in retail sales that tended to support forecasts of sustained growth in consumer spending in coming quarters. In addition, surveys of consumer sentiment, which had been more favorable recently, and sharply increased household net worth were seen as positive factors in the outlook for consumer expenditures. On the negative side, some members observed that the rise in consumer indebtedness and the recent increase in interest rates would tend to damp consumer spending. Given these financial crosscurrents, it was suggested that growth in consumer spending might approximate that of disposable income over the forecast horizon. ']
