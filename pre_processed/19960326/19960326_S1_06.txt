[' Industrial production rose sharply in February, more than offsetting a sizable decline in January. Part of the net increase in output over the January-February period reflected an upturn in aircraft production after the settlement of a strike at a major aircraft manufacturer. In addition, output of office and computing machines continued to rise at a rapid pace, and the production of other types of business equipment picked up. Output of consumer goods changed little on balance over the two-month period. Manufacturing production expanded about in line with capacity over the first two months of the year, leaving the overall rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity little changed. ']
