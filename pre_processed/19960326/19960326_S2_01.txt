[' The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the pace of economic expansion would pick up over coming months after a sluggish fourth quarter. Other than a better performance over the first half of 1996 associated with somewhat faster increase in final sales, this forecast differed little from that prepared for the previous meeting and indicated that the economy was expected to expand generally along its estimated potential. Consumer spending was projected to grow slightly more than disposable income; the favorable effect of higher equity prices on household wealth and the still-ample availability of credit were expected to outweigh persisting consumer concerns about job security and the effects of already high household debt burdens. Homebuilding activity was projected to decline a little in response to the recent backup in residential mortgage rates but to remain at a relatively high level. A less rapid pace of business investment in equipment and structures was expected in light of the decline over the past year in the rate of utilization of production capacity and the moderate growth projected for sales and profits. The external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period. The persisting impasse in the federal budget negotiations suggested little further fiscal contraction in coming quarters. Given the outlook for economic activity, rates of utilization of labor and capital were not expected to change materially and inflation was projected to increase modestly. ']
