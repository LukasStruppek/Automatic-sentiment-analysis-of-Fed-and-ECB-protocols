[' Business demand for durable equipment apparently remained fairly robust in early 1996. Incoming orders for computing equipment were particularly strong in January, and shipments of such equipment posted further healthy gains. With airline profits high and new models of airplanes being introduced, orders for aircraft had climbed rapidly over recent months. Orders for other types of equipment also had picked up on balance over the last several months, although shipments of such equipment dropped in January after a sizable rise in the fourth quarter. Nonresidential construction activity appeared to be growing more slowly: non-office commercial construction continued its upward trend but office, institutional, and industrial building activity had slowed noticeably in recent months, and contracts for those categories also had softened. Business inventories rebounded sharply in January from a large drop in December. Much of the January buildup in stocks occurred in manufacturing, where part of the backup may have been associated with delays in shipments as a result of winter storms. The inventory-sales ratio for the sector edged up in January but was little changed on balance in recent months. Inventories at the wholesale level also rose considerably in January; the inventory-sales ratio increased slightly but was still well below the high levels of last fall. Retail stocks recorded a modest rise in January after a sharp decline in December. The January increase was in line with the advance in sales, and the inventory-sales ratio for the sector as a whole was unchanged from December and remained well below levels seen over most of 1995.
