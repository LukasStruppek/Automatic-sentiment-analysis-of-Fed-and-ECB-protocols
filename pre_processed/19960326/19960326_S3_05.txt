[' Housing activity generally was expected to be well maintained in coming quarters, though likely to moderate to some extent from current levels in lagged response to the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates. The response of housing expenditures to rate increases was uncertain, and a few members commented that the prospective slowing in housing construction could be fairly pronounced. For the nearer term, however, recent data were indicative of considerable underlying strength in housing markets, especially in light of the adverse effects of notably unfavorable weather conditions in many parts of the country this winter. Those data tended to be supported by anecdotal reports of significant improvement in housing markets in several regions over the course of recent months. Contributing to that performance, however, might be a temporary acceleration of purchases by home buyers who anticipated further increases in mortgage interest rates. The latter were viewed, nonetheless, as still low in comparison with their average level over the past several years. ']
