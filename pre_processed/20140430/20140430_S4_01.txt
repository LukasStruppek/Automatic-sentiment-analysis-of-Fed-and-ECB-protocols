 Members viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that economic growth had picked up recently, following a sharp slowdown during the winter due in part to unusually severe weather conditions Although labor market indicators were mixed, on balance they showed further improvement The unemployment rate, however, remained elevated While household spending appeared to be rising more rapidly, business fixed investment had edged down and the recovery in the housing sector remained slow Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, but the extent of that restraint had diminished The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate Moreover, members continued to see risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced Inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective and was seen as posing possible risks to economic performance, but members anticipated that stable inflation expectations and strengthening economic activity would, over time, return inflation to the Committee's 2 percent target However, in light of their concerns about the possible persistence of low inflation, members agreed that inflation developments should be monitored carefully for evidence that inflation was moving back toward the Committee's longer-run objective
