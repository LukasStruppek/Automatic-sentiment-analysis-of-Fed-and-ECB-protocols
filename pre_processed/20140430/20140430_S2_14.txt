Conditions in short-term funding markets remained fairly stable over the intermeeting period. Take-up in the Federal Reserve's fixed-rate ON RRP exercise continued to be sensitive to the spread between market rates and the rate offered in the exercise, with higher take-up occurring on days when the market rate on repurchase agreements was close to or below the ON RRP rate. As has been the case since the ON RRP exercise began, money market funds increased their usage at quarter-end; take-up reached a record level of about $240 billion at the end of March. Part of the increase in ON RRP usage at the end of March relative to the end of December likely reflected higher counterparty allotment limits, which were raised from $3 billion to $7 billion during the first quarter. The allotment limit was subsequently increased to $10 billion per counterparty in early April. The seasonal paydown of short-term Treasury debt following the April tax date was accompanied by a notable pickup in participation at ON RRP operations, but Treasury repo rates generally remained very close to the ON RRP rate of 5 basis points.
