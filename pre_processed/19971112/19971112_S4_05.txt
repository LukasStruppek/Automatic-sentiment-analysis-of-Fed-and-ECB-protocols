[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity continued to grow rapidly in recent months. In labor markets, hiring has remained robust and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent in October, its low for the current economic expansion. Industrial production increased very rapidly in the third quarter, and appears to have remained strong in October. Retail sales also rose sharply in the third quarter, though at a moderating pace as the summer progressed. Housing starts, while fluctuating from month to month, were little changed on balance in the third quarter. Business fixed investment posted unusually strong increases in the latest quarter, and available indicators point to further sizable gains in coming months. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially on average in July and August from its rate in the second quarter. Price inflation has remained subdued despite some increase in the pace of advance in labor compensation. ']
