Private nonfarm payroll employment fell slightly further in May after a sharp drop in April and lackluster growth in the first quarter. Manufacturing recorded additional widespread job losses in May, and there were signs that weakness in employment was spreading to related sectors, notably wholesale trade and help-supply services. By contrast, construction employment rebounded in May, retracing part of its large April loss, and hiring in finance, insurance, and real estate remained brisk. The unemployment rate edged lower in May, to 4.4 percent, but initial unemployment insurance claims and other data suggested persisting softening in the labor market in that month.
