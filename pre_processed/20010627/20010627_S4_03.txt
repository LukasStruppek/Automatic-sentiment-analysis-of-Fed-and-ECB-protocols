All except one of the members accepted a proposal to retain the Committee's press statement that the risks would continue to be weighted toward economic weakness after today's easing move. The member who opposed additional policy easing expressed strong reservations about such a statement because in his view it likely would be interpreted as an intention to ease policy further, which was contrary to his own assessment that a more neutral outlook regarding the future course of policy was desirable. In the view of most members, however, the weakness of the recent information relating to the performance of the economy was consistent with unbalanced risks at least insofar as it pertained to the outlook for the rest of this year, and their primary policy concern at this point remained the strength of economic activity rather than potentially worsening inflation over the longer term.
