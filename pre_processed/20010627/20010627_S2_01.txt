The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that after a period of very slow growth associated in large part with an inventory correction, a sizable decline in capital spending, and a related sharp contraction in manufacturing output, the economic expansion would gradually regain strength over the forecast horizon and move back to a rate around the staff's current estimate of the growth of the economy's potential output. The period of sub-par expansion was expected to foster an appreciable easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation. Despite the substantial monetary easing that had been implemented already and the fiscal stimulus, including federal tax rebates, that was in train, the forecast anticipated that sluggish hiring and the decline in household wealth would restrain the growth of both consumer spending and housing demand. Business fixed investment, notably outlays for equipment and software, would be weaker for a while but would return to relatively robust growth after a period of adjustment of capital stocks to more desirable levels. The gradual strengthening of investment, together with a projected improvement in foreign economies that was seen as providing some support for U.S. exports, would foster the pickup in growth of demand and output.
