The near-term outlook for business fixed investment seemed less promising. The weakness in spending for new equipment and software had played a key role in the softening of the overall expansion of economic activity in recent quarters, and a material pickup in such expenditures did not appear likely until the latter part of this year or early next year. Indeed, anecdotal reports from many business firms indicated that they were delaying at least some equipment and software outlays until evidence of an upturn in their sales and earnings began to accumulate. Caution was especially pronounced among high-tech firms, many of which had experienced major cutbacks in the demand for their products and services. An analysis prepared for this meeting suggested that in the aggregate the apparent overhang of excess capital might not be large, but the dimensions and duration of the adjustment in spending on capital goods were a major source of uncertainty in the outlook, and there was some risk of substantially greater weakness in investment spending than was forecast for coming months. Beyond the nearer term, however, the prospects for an upturn in investment outlays seemed favorable in the context of profit opportunities associated with expectations of continued elevated rates of technological progress and rapid declines in the prices of new equipment. In this regard the members reviewed several staff reports that generally concluded that the growth of productivity in the years ahead was highly likely to remain appreciably stronger than it had been from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, though how much stronger was an open question. With regard to the outlook for nonresidential construction activity, members referred to signs of developing weakness in some commercial real estate markets, but there were few reports of overbuilding and the construction of commercial facilities was being well maintained in other parts of the country. On balance, further modest growth in nonresidential construction, though well below the average pace in recent quarters, was seen as a likely prospect.
