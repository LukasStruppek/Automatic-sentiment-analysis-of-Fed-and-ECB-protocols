At its meeting on May 15, 2001, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with a decrease of 50 basis points in the intended level of the federal funds rate, to about 4 percent. The members generally agreed that this action was necessary in light of the continuing weakness of the economic expansion and the lack of evidence that output growth had stabilized or was about to rebound, coupled with a climate of fragile business and consumer confidence. In addition, the members believed that the balance of risks remained weighted toward conditions that could generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.
