Business inventories on a book-value basis edged higher in April after a sizable runoff in the first quarter. Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing stocks were little changed in April, but shipments were down sharply and the aggregate inventory-shipments ratio for the sector remained on a steep upward trend, with many industries facing sizable inventory overhangs. In the wholesale sector, inventories rose in step with sales; the sector's inventory-sales ratio was unchanged in April and remained at the top of its range for the past twelve months. Retail inventories continued to decline in April, and the sector's inventory-sales ratio decreased further and was near the middle of its range for the past twelve months.
