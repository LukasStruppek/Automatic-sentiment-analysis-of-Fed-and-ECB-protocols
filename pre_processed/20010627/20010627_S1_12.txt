Core price inflation had moderated a little recently after a pickup earlier in the year. The core consumer price index (CPI) rose relatively slowly in April and May, and the increase in that index during the past twelve months was about the same as that during the previous twelve-month period. The core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) chain-type price index presented a similar picture, with inflation in April and May a little lower than earlier in the year and no change in inflation on a year-over-year basis. Core producer price inflation for finished goods also was subdued in the April-May period but edged higher on a year-over-year basis. There also were indications that upward pressures on energy prices had abated somewhat. In particular, the return of some domestic refineries to operation after maintenance or breakdowns and a surge in imports had replenished gasoline stocks, and as a result wholesale and retail gasoline prices had retreated recently. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers continued to rise in April and May at the relatively brisk rate that had prevailed over the past year.
