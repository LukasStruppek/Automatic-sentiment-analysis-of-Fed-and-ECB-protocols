 Committee members viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity had expanded at a moderate pace Labor market conditions showed further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remained elevated Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector strengthened further, but fiscal policy was restraining economic growth The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth would proceed at a moderate pace and result in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with its dual mandate With economic activity and employment continuing to grow at a moderate pace despite tighter fiscal policy, and with global financial conditions less strained, members generally saw the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall Inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting transitory influences, but longer-run inflation expectations were stable, and the Committee anticipated that inflation over the medium term would move closer to its 2 percent objective
