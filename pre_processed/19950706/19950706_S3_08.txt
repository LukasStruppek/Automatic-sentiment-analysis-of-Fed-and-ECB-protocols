[' A considerable downside risk in the view of many members was the outlook for exports. Economic activity in the major foreign industrial nations had been more sluggish than anticipated during the first half of the year, and this raised questions about the strength of the expansion in those countries and the related prospects for the faster growth in U.S. exports. Most of the major economies in Latin America also were projected to strengthen, and indeed such expectations were reflected in financial markets, but substantial problems remained that could undermine the favorable outlook. On the positive side, members observed that U.S. exports were now quite competitive in world markets, as evidenced by continuing gains in exports to numerous countries, and such a perception was reinforced by anecdotal reports of increasing foreign sales of a variety of products by firms around the country. On balance, some growth in exports remained a reasonable prospect but it might fall below current expectations. ']
