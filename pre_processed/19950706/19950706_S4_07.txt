[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the level of economic activity was about unchanged in the second quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment fell in April and May after posting reduced gains in the first quarter, and the civilian unemployment rate, at 5.7 percent in May, was up somewhat from its first-quarter average. Industrial production continued to decline in May, reflecting another cutback in the production of motor vehicles, and capacity utilization was down somewhat further. Total retail sales have been sluggish on average in recent months. Housing starts were about unchanged over April and May, but sales of new homes turned up sharply in May. Orders for nondefense capital goods have moderated somewhat in recent months but still point to considerable further expansion of spending on business equipment; nonresidential construction has continued to trend appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in April from its average rate in the first quarter. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices have increased faster on average thus far this year, though there were signs of some moderation in the most recent data; advances in labor compensation costs have remained subdued.
