[" At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one of the members indicated that they favored or could support a directive that called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and that included a bias toward possible further easing of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater monetary restraint might be acceptable or somewhat lesser monetary restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months. "]
