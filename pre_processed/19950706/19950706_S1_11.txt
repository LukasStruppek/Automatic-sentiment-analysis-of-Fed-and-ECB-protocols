[' Incoming data suggested that price inflation might be slowing a little after having picked up early in the year. Consumer prices rose a bit less in May; energy prices recorded another sizable increase, but food prices changed little and prices of other items advanced more slowly. However, for the twelve months ended in May, prices of nonfood, non-energy consumer items increased slightly more than in the preceding twelve months. At the producer level, prices of finished goods were unchanged in May, reflecting declines in the prices of finished foods and finished energy goods; excluding food and energy, prices of finished goods rose in May at the same rate as in April. For the year ending in May, producer prices rose moderately after being essentially unchanged in the previous year. At earlier stages of production, producer prices grew at a considerably slower rate or declined in May, suggesting some easing of cost pressures over the next few months. Average hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector accelerated in the first quarter of the year, owing in large part to temporary developments. Over the year ended in March, this compensation measure increased somewhat more than it had over the previous year. Average hourly earnings declined in May, but the change in hourly earnings over the past twelve months was slightly larger than the advance over the preceding twelve-month period. ']
