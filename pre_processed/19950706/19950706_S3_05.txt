[' Business fixed investment appeared to have moderated since earlier in the year, though expenditures for both producer durable equipment and nonresidential structures were still registering strong gains. Further moderation was anticipated over the course of coming quarters in association with slower growth in business sales and decreased pressures on producer resources. While some concern was expressed about the vulnerability of capital spending to a downturn in the growth of sales, the members generally expected this sector of the economy to remain a positive factor in the expansion. The ready availability of financing on favorable terms and the ongoing need to modernize equipment and other producer resources for competitive reasons, notably to take advantage of continuing improvements in computer and other technologies, should foster continued overall growth in business investment. Members also noted that the strength in business profits, though likely to moderate cyclically at some point, remained a favorable factor undergirding business capital spending. ']
