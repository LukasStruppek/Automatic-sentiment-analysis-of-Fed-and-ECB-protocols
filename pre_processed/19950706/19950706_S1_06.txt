[' Industrial production continued to weaken in May, and incoming data suggested a further decline in June. Manufacturing output fell in May for a fourth consecutive month, reflecting another cutback in the production of motor vehicles. Output of non-auto manufactured goods was unchanged, with increases in the production of nondurable consumer goods and non-auto business equipment offsetting declines in output elsewhere. Utilization of manufacturing capacity dropped again in May but was still at a relatively high level. ']
