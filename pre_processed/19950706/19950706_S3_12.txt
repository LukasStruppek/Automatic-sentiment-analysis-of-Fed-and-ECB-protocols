[" With regard to M2, a majority of the members favored or could accept a proposal to maintain the existing 1 to 5 percent range for both years. These members noted that M2 growth was projected to remain within the current range, though in the upper half in 1995 and at the top in 1996. While recognizing that expansion at a rate above that range could not be ruled out, especially for 1996, they suggested that an increase in the range, at a time when substantial uncertainties continued to surround the relationship of M2 to broad measures of economic performance, would imply a degree of confidence regarding the relationship that the Committee did not possess at this point. Moreover, if the more normal behavior of velocity over the past several quarters were to continue, a 1 to 5 percent range for growth of M2 likely would prove consistent with the Committee's ultimate objectives of sustained economic expansion and reasonable price stability. There was concern that an increase in the M2 range could foster a misreading of the Committee's intentions, especially if some easing in policy were to be approved during this meeting, explanations of the technical reasons notwithstanding.
