[" In the Committee's discussion, the members took account of the accelerated rates of M2 and M3 growth since early spring that, for the year to date, had lifted the expansion of M2 to the upper half of the Committee's range and the expansion of M3 further above its range. According to a staff projection, the growth of both aggregates was likely to moderate over the balance of the year, assuming an unchanged monetary policy, as rates paid on various components of the aggregates were adjusted more fully to the reductions in market interest rates that had occurred since early in the year. Even so, the projected growth of the broad aggregates would remain well above that experienced over the last several years. These developments implied velocity behavior for these aggregates that was more in line with historical patterns after several years of pronounced and atypical velocity increases. The members noted that financial innovations, technical changes, and deregulation had obscured historical distinctions among various financial instruments and had affected the extent to which holders might shift funds into or out of components of the monetary aggregates in response to changing interest rate patterns. As a result, substantial uncertainty remained about projections of money growth and the future relationships of money and debt to the basic objectives of monetary policy. Against this background, members expressed somewhat differing views regarding appropriate ranges for the growth of M2 and M3 in 1995 and 1996. "]
