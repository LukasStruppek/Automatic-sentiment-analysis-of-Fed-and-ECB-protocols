[' In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee sets its long-run ranges for the money and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members provided their individual projections of the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 1995 and 1996. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP for 1995 as a whole had a central tendency of 1-1/2 to 2 percent, reflecting expectations of a pickup in growth to a moderate pace in the second half of the year; for 1996, projections of growth in real GDP centered on a range of 2-1/4 to 2-3/4 percent. With regard to the expansion of nominal GDP, the growth forecasts were concentrated in a range of 4-1/4 to 4-3/4 percent for 1995 and 4-3/4 to 5-3/8 percent for 1996. The rate of unemployment associated with these forecasts was expected to edge higher in the second half of this year to a consensus range of 5-3/4 to 6-1/8 percent in the fourth quarters of both 1995 and 1996. Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, pointed to a small decline over the projection horizon; the projections converged on rates of 3-1/8 to 3-3/8 percent for 1995 and 2-7/8 to 3-1/4 percent for 1996.
