[" The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity would expand sluggishly over the next few months as business firms adjusted production schedules to bring inventories into better alignment with sales. Subsequently, as inventory positions were corrected, and with underlying support for final sales from the favorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally in the equity and debt markets, the economy would begin to expand at a moderate pace. The forecast assumed a modest step-up in the pace of consumer spending in response to some diminution of concerns about job prospects and incomes as well as improved financial conditions and household balance sheets. Homebuilding was projected to pick up somewhat in lagged response to the recent decline in mortgage rates and the related improvement in housing affordability. Business outlays for new equipment were expected to slow from the very rapid pace of the past few years in response to the slower growth of sales and profits, but lower costs of capital and the ready availability of financing would help to sustain appreciable growth in such investment. Export expansion would pick up in response to some anticipated strengthening in the economies of major U.S. trading partners. Considerable uncertainty continued to surround the fiscal outlook, but in light of recent developments the forecast now reflected a greater degree of fiscal restraint. In the staff's judgment, the prospects for some easing of pressure on labor and other resources suggested that price inflation likely would moderate from its recently higher level. "]
