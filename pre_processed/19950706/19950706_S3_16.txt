[" Mr. Blinder and Ms. Yellen dissented on a technical judgment, not a policy difference. They noted that if growth in the demand for M2 were close to historic norms in 1995 or 1996, as indeed it had been for some time, then the Committee members' projections for nominal GDP would likely imply M2 growth near the top of, or even above, the current range. While the relationship between the growth of M2 and that of nominal GDP remained subject to a great deal of uncertainty, they were persuaded that the range--in fact, the midpoint of the range--should normally be consistent with members' forecasts of nominal GDP growth. This would be truer to the spirit of the aggregates targeting provision in the Federal Reserve Act. From this perspective, they viewed a higher M2 range for 1995 and 1996 as clearly preferable in communicating the Committee's objectives for the economy and its expectations for money growth. "]
