[" In the course of the Committee's discussion of its monetary growth ranges, members commented on the failure of the monetary aggregates to provide a reliable nominal anchor for the conduct of monetary policy in recent years. Moreover, the restoration of historic relationships, or the emergence of new but stable relationships, between money growth and measures of progress toward broad economic objectives could not be predicted with any degree of confidence. Some members expressed the view that in these circumstances the Committee needed to continue to look at potential alternative approaches to guide the formulation of policy and to communicate its intentions to the public, especially with respect to the Committee's objective of promoting price stability over time.
