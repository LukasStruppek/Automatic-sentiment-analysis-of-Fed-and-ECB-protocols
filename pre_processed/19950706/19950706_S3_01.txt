[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the apparent pause in the expansion was likely to prove temporary, and their forecasts generally pointed to an upturn in overall economic activity to a pace in the neighborhood of the economy's potential by the latter part of this year or early 1996. Many emphasized that the prospects for a strengthening economy were enhanced by the drop in intermediate- and long-term interest rates and the rise in equity prices. In the view of most members, however, the risks to the outlook were tilted to the downside. Several stressed that the ongoing adjustments to business inventories could prove to be more pronounced and of longer duration than they anticipated, with negative repercussions on production and incomes and in turn on consumer spending and business investment. Other downside risks included the adverse implications for exports of potentially less-than-projected expansion in a number of major foreign economies. Nonetheless, recent developments suggested that the period of maximum risk to the domestic expansion might have passed. With pressures on resources having diminished and likely to ease somewhat further and with labor costs remaining subdued, the risk of continuing increases in inflation had fallen considerably; indeed, in the view of many members inflation should moderate over the projection period.
