[' With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, most of the members who favored some easing also preferred an asymmetric directive, including a marked preference on the part of those who supported greater easing than the majority. An asymmetric directive was consistent with the view shared by most members that the risks to the expansion were biased to the downside, but no member expressed a strong presumption about the likely need to ease policy during the weeks ahead. The Committee would, of course, monitor and respond as needed to the incoming economic information. ']
