[' The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would expand in the second half of the year at a rate a little above that of its estimated potential and then would increase at a slower and more sustainable rate in 1998. Growth of consumer spending, supported by high levels of household wealth and further projected gains in employment and income, was expected to remain fairly brisk over the forecast horizon. Business spending on equipment and structures was anticipated to continue to outpace the overall expansion of the economy, though the differential would tend to narrow over time in association with the gradual diminution of increases in sales and profits that was expected to be associated with moderating economic growth. Housing construction was projected to drift lower over coming quarters, partly in conjunction with the rise in mortgage interest rates that already had occurred but also in response to the smaller increases expected in household income. The staff continued to anticipate that fiscal policy and the external sector would exert mild restraint on the expansion of economic activity. With resource utilization high and labor compensation gradually accelerating, core consumer price inflation was forecast to drift slightly higher. ']
