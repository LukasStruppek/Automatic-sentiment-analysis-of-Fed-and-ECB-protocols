[' Industrial production was unchanged in April after having recorded sizable increases in March and other recent months; declines in mining and manufacturing were offset by a large rise in utility output. The drop in manufacturing production reflected a sharp decline in the output of motor vehicles and parts that was largely related to the lagged effects of strike activity in recent months. The output of manufactured goods other than motor vehicles and parts rose moderately in April: the production of business equipment posted another solid gain while the output of consumer goods and construction supplies was unchanged. The rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity fell in April, reflecting the decline in motor vehicle output, but it remained relatively high. ']
