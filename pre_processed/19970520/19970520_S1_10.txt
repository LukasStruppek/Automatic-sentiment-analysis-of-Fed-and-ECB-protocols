[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially on balance over January and February from the temporarily depressed rate in the fourth quarter of last year and was about the same as the rate in the third quarter. A surge in imports reflected a rebound in the importation of automotive products from the strike-reduced level of the fourth quarter, further expansion in purchases of imported computers, and an upturn in imports of semiconductors after four quarters of declines. By contrast, exports of goods and services rose only slightly in the January-February period; exports of automotive products were up sharply, but sizable increases in exports of chemicals, computers, and semiconductors were largely offset by declines in other non-automotive trade categories. Recent economic information on the foreign G-7 countries, including some preliminary indicators for the second quarter, suggested that the growth of output had strengthened somewhat on average in these countries. Activity in continental Europe, though still weak, was improving, while the economies of Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom remained strong. Economic activity continued to expand rapidly on average in the major developing countries in the first quarter. ']
