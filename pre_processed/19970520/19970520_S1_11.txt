[' Recent data indicated that price inflation remained moderate despite a gradual acceleration of labor costs. Increases in consumer prices were held down in March and April by sizable declines in energy prices and a small net reduction in food prices. Consumer prices for items other than food and energy advanced at a moderate rate over the two months, and over the twelve months ended in April they increased by the same amount as in the previous twelve months. Producer prices fell in both March and April, reflecting large declines in energy prices. Excluding food and energy, producer prices edged lower in April after rising a sizable amount in March. Core producer prices increased considerably less over the twelve months ended in April than over the previous twelve months. At earlier stages of production, producer prices registered declines both in recent months and for the twelve months ended in April. An upward creep in the growth of labor costs was apparent in data on the hourly compensation of private industry workers; although the rise in the first three months of 1997 was smaller than the increase in the fourth quarter, the advance over the twelve months ended in March was larger than that over the previous twelve months. A similar but more pronounced pattern was evident in data on average hourly earnings for production or nonsupervisory workers. ']
