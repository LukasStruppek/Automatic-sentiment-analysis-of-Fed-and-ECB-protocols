[' A surge in nonfarm business inventory investment accounted for a substantial portion of the acceleration in output in the first quarter, and an anticipated moderation in the accumulation of inventories was an important element in forecasts of greatly reduced economic growth in the current quarter. In keeping with business practices aimed at achieving or maintaining lean inventory-sales ratios, inventory investment was projected to continue at a relatively subdued pace in coming quarters. A number of members expressed the view, however, that stockbuilding represented an upside risk in the economic outlook, at least in the nearer term. While there were some indications of efforts to pare inventories in recent months, generally optimistic business sentiment and currently trim inventories in most industries might well foster efforts to accumulate stocks at a relatively rapid pace, especially if more-buoyant-than-anticipated sales were to stimulate a precautionary demand for inventories as had occurred in 1994.
