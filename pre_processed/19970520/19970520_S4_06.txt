[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in economic activity has slowed after surging in late 1996 and earlier this year. Private nonfarm payroll employment increased at a considerably reduced pace over March and April, but the civilian unemployment rate fell appreciably to 4.9 percent in April. Industrial production was flat in April following sizable gains over previous months. Nominal retail sales were unchanged in March and declined in April after a considerable advance in earlier months. Housing activity in March and April was little changed from other recent months. Available indicators point to further sizable gains in business fixed investment. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in January-February from its temporarily depressed rate in the fourth quarter. Underlying price inflation has remained subdued. ']
