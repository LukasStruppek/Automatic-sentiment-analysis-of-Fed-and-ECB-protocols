[' The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened slightly in January but was little changed from its average level in the fourth quarter. The value of both exports and imports dropped sharply in January from the December levels. The decline in imports was spread widely among major trade categories, but the decrease in exports largely reflected a reduction in shipments of aircraft after a strong December rise. Among the major foreign industrialized countries, the level of real activity contracted further in the fourth quarter in Japan, western Germany, and France; for the first quarter, the limited data available were generally weak for Japan and France but somewhat more mixed for western Germany. By contrast, economic activity appeared to be increasing in Canada and the United Kingdom. ']
