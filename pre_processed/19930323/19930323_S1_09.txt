[' Business inventories appeared to have edged lower in January. In manufacturing, factory stocks were drawn down further, and most industries had relatively low stocks-to-shipments ratios. Among wholesalers, strong January sales pulled down inventories at many types of establishments; in numerous cases, a large accumulation of stocks in the fourth quarter was reversed. For the wholesale sector as a whole, the inventories-to-sales ratio in January was near the bottom of the range of the past two years. Retail inventories rose somewhat further in January after a large December increase. Stocks at automotive dealers accounted for all of the January accumulation. At retail stores other than auto dealers, the ratio of inventories-to-sales remained within the narrow range observed over the past year. ']
