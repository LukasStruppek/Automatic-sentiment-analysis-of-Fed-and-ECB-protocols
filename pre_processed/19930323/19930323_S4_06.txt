[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity has increased at a more moderate pace in the early months of 1993 after expanding robustly in the fourth quarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment registered a sharp increase in February following generally small advances in previous months, and the civilian unemployment rate edged down further to 7.0 percent. Industrial production continued to post solid gains in January and February. Retail sales increased somewhat further over the first two months of the year after a fourth-quarter surge. Housing starts slipped in early 1993 after registering sizable gains late last year. Incoming data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods suggest a further brisk advance in outlays for business equipment, while nonresidential construction has remained soft. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was essentially unchanged in January from its average level in the fourth quarter, but both exports and imports were substantially lower. Increases in wages have remained subdued, but recent advances in consumer and producer prices have been larger than those recorded in the latter part of 1992. ']
