[' Messrs. Angell and Lindsey indicated that their concerns about the outlook for inflation prompted them to favor an immediate move to tighten reserve conditions. In their view, such an action was desirable not only to arrest the possible emergence of greater inflation but especially to promote further disinflation. They were persuaded that monetary policy currently was overly accommodative as suggested by various indicators such as recent data on consumer and producer prices, the upswing in commodity prices, the low level of real short-term interest rates, and what in their judgment was a relatively depressed foreign exchange value of the dollar given the comparative strength of the U.S. economy and international interest rate trends. They noted that the current federal funds rate was probably not sustainable in the long term and that a tightening move at this time might well avoid the need for more sizable and potentially disruptive policy actions later.
