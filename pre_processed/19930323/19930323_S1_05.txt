The strong job gains in construction, services, and retail trade in February apparently reflected to some extent a partial reversal of the special factors that had depressed reported employment in these sectors in previous months. Since December, initial claims for unemployment insurance had fluctuated in a range that was consistent with further modest growth in employment. The civilian unemployment rate edged lower again in February, to 7.0 percent. ']
