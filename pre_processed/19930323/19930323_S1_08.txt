[' Incoming data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods suggested a further brisk advance in outlays for business equipment in coming months. In January, a decline in shipments of nondefense capital goods only partially reversed a large December rise, as a surge in shipments of computing equipment helped sustain the overall level. Shipments of complete civilian aircraft posted a solid gain in January. The increase appeared to be concentrated in sales to foreign purchasers; in the domestic airline industry, intense competition was forcing cutbacks of unprofitable routes and reductions in both the number of planes in service and orders for new planes. Shipments of durable equipment other than computers and aircraft fell in January to about the level of the fourth quarter. On the other hand, the January reading on new orders for these goods was well above the average for the fourth quarter, suggesting that additional advances in shipments might lie ahead. Nonresidential construction activity was down slightly further in January, reflecting persisting declines in office and industrial building in an environment of excess supply and some continuing, though perhaps lessening, downward pressure on the prices of such structures.
