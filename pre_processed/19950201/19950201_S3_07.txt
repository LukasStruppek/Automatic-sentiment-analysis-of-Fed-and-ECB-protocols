[' The pace of inventory accumulation in recent quarters was viewed as unsustainable and a decline in inventory investment was seen as likely over the forecast horizon, though the precise timing and extent were impossible to predict. While slower growth in final demand might in most circumstances stimulate a relatively sharp adjustment in inventory investment, members cited factors that could mute the size of that adjustment and its effects on overall GDP. These included relatively low inventory/sales ratios across much of the economy and little anecdotal or other evidence of unintended inventory accumulation. Moreover, because an unusually large share of the inventory buildup in recent quarters appeared to involve imports, a cutback in such investment should tend to have a smaller-than-usual impact on domestic production. There was no current evidence that inventory investment was slowing, and indeed recent data on business loans at banks might suggest some acceleration in inventory accumulation since the beginning of the year. Nonetheless, as more moderate growth in final demand began to emerge, concerns about the availability of materials used in the production process or stocks needed to meet market demand should diminish, and business firms could be expected to trim their demand for inventories, perhaps aggressively for a time. Indeed, this sector of the economy might well account for much of the slowing in the expansion for some period of time during the year ahead. ']
