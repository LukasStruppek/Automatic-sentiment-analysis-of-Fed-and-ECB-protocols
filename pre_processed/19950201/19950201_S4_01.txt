[" All the members endorsed a proposal to adopt the ranges that the Committee had set on a tentative basis in July 1994. While some acceleration in the growth of the broad monetary aggregates from the pace in 1994 could be anticipated over the year ahead according to a staff analysis, monetary expansion within the ranges in question appeared to be consistent with the moderation in the expansion of nominal GDP that the members were projecting for 1995 and that they viewed as desirable to head off increasing inflation. Moreover, the ranges for the broad monetary aggregates had been reduced over the past decade to levels that, notably in the case of M2, should now be consistent over long periods with the Committee's objectives for stable prices and maximum sustainable economic growth. This outcome would depend on the restoration over time of the historical velocity patterns linking the monetary aggregates to broad measures of economic performance, including a level velocity trend for M2. It was noted in this regard that until recent years the growth of M3 had tended to exceed that of M2--a pattern that seemed to be re-emerging--and therefore a somewhat higher range might be set for M3 than for M2. However, the members did not believe that a persuasive argument could be made at this juncture for raising the M3 range, though they did not want to rule out the option of doing so later, possibly when the ranges were reviewed at midyear. Indeed, to make the change at this point might convey a misleading message regarding the Committee's policy intentions or its confidence in prospective monetary growth relationships. "]
