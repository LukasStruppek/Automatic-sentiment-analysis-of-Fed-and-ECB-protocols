[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a strong further rise in economic activity during the closing months of 1994. Nonfarm payroll employment was up considerably further in December after a sharp increase in November, and the civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.4 percent. Industrial production registered another large advance in December and capacity utilization continued to move up from already high levels. Current estimates indicate little change in retail sales over November and December, while housing starts posted sizable gains on balance over the two months. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong expansion in spending on business equipment; permits for nonresidential construction have been trending appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened somewhat in October-November from its average rate in the third quarter. Prices of many materials have continued to move up rapidly, but broad indexes of prices for consumer goods and services have increased moderately on average over recent months. ']
