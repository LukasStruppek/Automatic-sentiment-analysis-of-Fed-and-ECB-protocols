[' The Committee also approved at this meeting an increase from $5 billion to $20 billion in the amount of eligible foreign currencies that the System is prepared to "warehouse" for the Treasury and the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The purpose of the warehousing facility, which has been in place for many years, is to supplement the U.S. dollar resources of the Treasury and the ESF for financing purchases of foreign currencies and related international operations. The size of the warehousing facility had ranged up to $15 billion in past years, but it was reduced to $5 billion in February 1992. The expansion of the warehousing agreement at this meeting was intended to facilitate U.S. participation in the Multilateral Program to Restore Financial Stability in Mexico, announced by President Clinton on January 31, 1995, by warehousing up to $20 billion in German marks and Japanese yen held by the Treasury through the ESF. The Committee will review each year the need to maintain this level of warehousing authority in light of the progress and needs of the Program. ']
