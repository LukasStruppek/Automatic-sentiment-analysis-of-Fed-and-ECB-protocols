[' In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat over the intermeeting period. The dollar fell substantially against the mark, which was buoyed by safe-haven inflows from weaker European currencies, but dropped less against the yen. One factor that weighed against the dollar was uncertainty about the consequences for the U.S. economy of the sharp depreciation of the Mexican peso and the related economic and financial problems in Mexico and other developing economies; market participants expressed some concern that the crisis might constrain U.S. monetary policy in the event of further domestic inflation pressures and that the counterpart to the large prospective reduction in the Mexican current account deficit would lie importantly in the already substantial U.S. deficit.
