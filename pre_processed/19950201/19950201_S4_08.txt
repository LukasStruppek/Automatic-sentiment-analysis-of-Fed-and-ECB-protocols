[" At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated that they could support a directive that called for increasing somewhat the degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the implementation of this policy, account would be taken of a possible increase of 1/2 percentage in the discount rate that was under consideration by the Board of Governors. The members also agreed that the directive should not include any presumption about possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months. "]
