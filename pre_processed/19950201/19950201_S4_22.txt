[" The full substance of the Committee's deliberations relating to each policy decision will continue to be reported, as is the current practice, in comprehensive minutes of the meeting that are released two or three days following the next regularly scheduled meeting. For historians and other students of monetary policymaking, those minutes will be supplemented by lightly edited transcripts of the discussion at each Committee meeting. For recent and future meetings, transcripts for an entire year will be released with a five-year lag; earlier transcripts dating back to March 1976 will continue to be released on an ongoing basis as the light editing process is completed. Continuing the practice followed since the beginning of 1994, transcripts prepared by the Committee's Secretariat will be circulated to each participant to verify his or her comments, and only changes that clarify meaning, such as the correction of grammar or transcription errors, will be permitted. A limited amount of material will be withheld from the publicly released version of these documents, primarily to protect the confidentiality of foreign and domestic sources of information that likely would be lost if the information they provide were to be made public. As required by law, a complete, unredacted version of the transcript of each meeting will be turned over to the National Archives after 30 years have elapsed. "]
