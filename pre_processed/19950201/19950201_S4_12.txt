[" Members who voted to approve these proposals were persuaded that the nature and severity of Mexico's financial problems could not be contained without making available substantial financial assistance to the Government of Mexico. The financial support provided by the United States would be accompanied by similar assistance from the IMF and would be conditioned on Mexico's commitment to implement major changes in its economic policies, including monetary policy. It was emphasized during the Committee's discussion that the United States had a strong interest in encouraging the restoration of stability in Mexico for numerous reasons, including the growth of trade between the two nations and the resulting creation of jobs in both countries. Moreover, Mexico's financial problems appeared to be spreading to a number of other nations and adversely affecting the dollar in the foreign exchange markets. The participation of the Federal Reserve in this effort was strongly endorsed by the Administration and the overall program had the support of the bipartisan leadership in the Congress. Apart from temporary financial resources, the Federal Reserve was in a position to supply expertise and experience that were not readily available elsewhere. On the negative side, the members acknowledged that there could be no assurances that the rescue program would succeed, but its scale, its multinational character, and the apparent willingness of Mexican officials to pursue the difficult policies needed to assure success were grounds for optimism.
