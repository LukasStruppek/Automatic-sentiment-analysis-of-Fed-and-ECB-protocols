[' In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates in 1995 that it had established on a tentative basis at its meeting in July 1994. The tentative ranges included expansion of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had been set provisionally at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The ranges for M2 and M3 were unchanged from those that the Committee had used in 1994, while the range for debt was one percentage point lower. ']
