[" Concerning the possible need to adjust policy during the intermeeting period, the members were unanimously in favor of adopting a symmetric directive. Given a decision to implement some tightening in monetary policy at this meeting, they did not believe that there should be a presumption toward possible further tightening in this period. A number of members observed that further monetary restraint might not be needed if, in line with their expectations, the incoming evidence on the performance of the economy suggested that the expansion was moderating sufficiently for the economy to return to a growth path consistent with containing inflation pressures. In any event, the Committee's most difficult decision over the next several quarters was likely to be that of determining when further tightening was no longer desirable. "]
