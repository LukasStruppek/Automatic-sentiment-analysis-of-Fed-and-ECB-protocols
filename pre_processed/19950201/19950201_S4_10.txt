[" On December 30, 1994, the Committee approved a temporary increase from $3 billion to $4-1/2 billion in the System's reciprocal currency (swap) agreement with the Bank of Mexico and it also approved the activation of that agreement. The Committee approved a further temporary increase of $1-1/2 billion and activation of that amount at this meeting, thereby raising the swap arrangement with the Bank of Mexico to a level of $6 billion, consisting of the regular $3 billion line and a special $3 billion line. The special $3 billion line may be drawn on until January 31, 1996. Drawings would be for three-month periods and could be renewed a maximum of three times. Once a drawing on the special line is repaid, the size of the line will be reduced pari passu. All drawings on the special line will have to be repaid no later than January 31, 1997. The terms and conditions for use of the permanent $3 billion swap facility with the Bank of Mexico remain unchanged and drawings, once repaid, will require Committee action prior to subsequent use. The Treasury has undertaken to assure the repayment of any swap drawing by the Bank of Mexico on the $6 billion in lines that is outstanding more than 12 months. "]
