[" Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December, and data for the first half of January suggested a further acceleration in that month. Much of the pickup in M2 in December was due to rapid expansion in overnight repurchase agreements and overnight Eurodollars, which outweighed a further contraction of liquid accounts associated in part with depositor efforts to obtain higher returns by shifting funds into market instruments. The faster growth of M3 reflected, in addition to the acceleration of its M2 component, bank use of large CDs and nondeposit sources of funds to finance relatively robust demands for credit. From the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994, M2 grew at the lower end of the Committee's range for 1994 and M3 in the lower half of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months, and for 1994 it was in the lower half of its monitoring range. "]
