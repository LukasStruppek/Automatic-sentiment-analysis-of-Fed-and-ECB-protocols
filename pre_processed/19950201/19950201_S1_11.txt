[' Consumer price inflation slowed a little in December despite a jump in food prices that was only partly offset by a decline in energy prices. Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices edged up in December and rose significantly less in 1994 than in 1993. At the producer level, prices of finished goods also advanced more slowly in December, with a drop in energy prices balancing a surge in food prices. Prices of finished goods other than food and energy increased modestly in 1994 after being held down in 1993 by a sharp drop in the prices of tobacco products. In contrast to prices of finished goods, price inflation at earlier stages of production picked up in 1994. For intermediate goods other than food and energy items, prices rose at a faster rate in the second half of 1994, with the pickup most clearly evident in materials used in manufacturing. Prices of crude materials rose rapidly in the second half of 1994 and for the year as a whole. Increases in labor costs remained moderate. Average hourly earnings were little changed on balance over November and December, and for the year as a whole they advanced only slightly more than in 1993. More broadly, hourly compensation of private industry workers increased more slowly in the fourth quarter than in any of the previous three quarters of 1994, and the rise for the year was significantly less than in 1993.
