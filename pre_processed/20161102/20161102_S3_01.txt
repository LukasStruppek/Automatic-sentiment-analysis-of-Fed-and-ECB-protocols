 In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that growth of economic activity had picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of the year Job gains had been solid in recent months, although the unemployment rate was little changed Household spending had been rising moderately, but business fixed investment had remained soft Inflation had increased somewhat since earlier this year but remained below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports Market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved up but remained low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had changed little, on balance, in recent months Domestic and global asset markets remained relatively calm over the intermeeting period, and US financial conditions continued to be broadly accommodative
