[' Members anticipated that building activity, notably housing construction, would provide some stimulus to the expansion. Although indicators of housing activity were somewhat mixed for the nation as a whole, sales of new and existing homes were brisk in many regions and even sales of second homes were reported to be improving in some areas. Prospective homebuyers continued to exercise considerable caution, but reductions in mortgage rates and generally improved affordability pointed to rising housing sales and construction over the quarters ahead. In the nonresidential sector, there was growing evidence of some strengthening in the construction of commercial and institutional structures, but overcapacity was likely to depress the construction of new office buildings for an extended period in most parts of the country. In some areas, infrastructure and other rebuilding associated with the recent floods was likely to stimulate some construction activity later this year. ']
