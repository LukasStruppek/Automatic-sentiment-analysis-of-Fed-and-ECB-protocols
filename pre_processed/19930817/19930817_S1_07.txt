[" Retail sales increased slightly further in July after a sizable rise in the second quarter. Spending on automobiles was down for a second straight month, but sales were strong at apparel, furniture and appliance, and general merchandise stores. Total housing starts, depressed by wet weather and floods in some areas of the country, were down somewhat in July; however, permit issuance moved up, suggesting that homebuilding activity remained in a mild uptrend. In addition, consumer surveys indicated that attitudes toward homebuying continued to be strongly positive during July, and builders' assessments of home sales improved substantially. "]
