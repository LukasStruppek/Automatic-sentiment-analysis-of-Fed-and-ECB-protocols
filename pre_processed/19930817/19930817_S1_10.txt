[' The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was considerably smaller in May than the deficits recorded in March and April: however, the deficit for April and May combined was larger than the average rate for the first quarter. The value of exports rose slightly in May; increases in sales abroad of industrial supplies, machinery, and consumer goods offset declines in agricultural products, civilian aircraft, and motor vehicles and parts. A drop in the value of imports was spread across a wide range of products, particularly automotive products, consumer goods, and oil. The economic performance of the major foreign industrial countries was mixed in the second quarter. Output continued to decline in western Germany, and economic activity in Japan appeared to have stalled after modest growth in the first quarter. In contrast, economic recovery continued in Canada and the United Kingdom. ']
