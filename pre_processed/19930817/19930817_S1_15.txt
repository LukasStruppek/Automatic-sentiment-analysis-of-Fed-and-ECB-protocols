[" In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was about unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar strengthened slightly against the German mark, but it rose by significantly more against most other European currencies in the Exchange Rate Mechanism in the aftermath of a widening of the margins within which participating currencies are allowed to fluctuate relative to each other. The widening, which was in response to massive selling pressures on the French franc and several other currencies, followed sharp increases in short-term interest rates in the affected countries. With exchange market participants continuing to focus on Japan's trade surplus, the dollar fell substantially against the yen. "]
