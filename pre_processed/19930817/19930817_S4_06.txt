[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased in July at a rate close to its average advance in earlier months of the year, and the civilian unemployment rate declined to 6.8 percent. Industrial production turned up in July after posting small declines in May and June. Retail sales edged higher in July following a sizable rise in the second quarter. Housing starts were down somewhat in July, but permits moved up. Available indicators point to continued expansion in business capital spending. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit declined in May, but for April and May combined it was larger than its average rate in the first quarter. After rising at a faster rate in the early part of the year, consumer prices have changed little and producer prices have fallen in recent months. ']
