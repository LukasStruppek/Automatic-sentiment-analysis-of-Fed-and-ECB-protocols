[" Members observed that the more favorable performance of key measures of prices in recent months had tended to relieve earlier concerns about a possible worsening of inflation. However, because the recent price indexes probably overstated the improvement in the trend rate of inflation, it was too early to determine whether they pointed to renewed disinflation. In any event, a number of fundamental factors appeared to have favorable implications for the inflation outlook, notably the prospect that some slack in labor and capital resources would persist in the context of projections that pointed to a relatively moderate rate of economic expansion. Members continued to cite reports from numerous business firms regarding their inability to raise prices because of the highly competitive markets in which those firms had to operate. Many business contacts also referred to the absence of significant increases--and indeed to occasional decreases--in the costs of their outside purchases. Oil price developments in world markets and the ongoing competition from foreign producers also were noted as favorable elements in the outlook for inflation. On the negative side, adverse weather conditions in recent months including severe floods in the Midwest appeared to have fostered some upward pressure on food prices, and higher taxes would raise gasoline prices in the fourth quarter. Perhaps of greater significance, business contacts and surveys of households indicated persisting expectations that inflation would rise at some point. In this connection, however, passage of the federal deficit-reduction legislation and the Committee's reaffirmation in its directive and in congressional testimony of its commitment to price stability seemed to have had a constructive effect on attitudes in financial markets and on long-term interest rates, and these developments could prove to be harbingers of more favorable inflation attitudes more generally.
