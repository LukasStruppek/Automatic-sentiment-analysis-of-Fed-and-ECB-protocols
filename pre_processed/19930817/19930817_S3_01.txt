[" In the Committee's discussion of prospective economic conditions, members commented that recent developments had not materially altered the outlook for moderate and sustained growth in economic activity. Despite widespread indications of pessimistic consumer and business attitudes, overall consumer spending and business investment appeared to be reasonably well maintained. Likewise, the outlook for increased fiscal restraint associated with the recently enacted deficit-reduction legislation needed to be weighed against the favorable effects on spending of reduced interest rates in intermediate- and long-term debt markets, the improved balance sheets of consumers and businesses, and the indications of a somewhat better availability of loans from financial intermediaries. In an environment of moderate economic growth, the fundamentals bearing on the outlook for inflation were consistent with further disinflation, and the members drew some encouragement from consumer and producer price developments in recent months. Several cautioned, however, that recent price measures probably overstated the reduction in inflation, just as the surge in prices earlier in the year seemed to have overstated the underlying inflation trend. Members also referred to the persistence of inflationary expectations among business executives and consumers. Thus, while the rise in inflation appeared to have been arrested, any further progress toward price stability was likely to be limited over the quarters ahead. "]
