[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, the members agreed that recent developments pointed to the desirability of a steady policy course. While economic growth did not seem particularly robust, neither was it clear that a disinflationary trend had been reestablished. Many members observed that real short-term interest rates were at very low levels, indeed slightly negative by some calculations, and while real intermediate- and long-term interest rates were higher, it was apparent that monetary policy was in an accommodative posture. This conclusion was seen as reinforcing the view that monetary policy probably would have to move in the direction of restraint at some point to resist any incipient tendency for inflationary pressures to intensify. For now, the relatively slow economic expansion in the first half of the year, the fiscal restraint associated with the deficit-reduction legislation, other obstacles to economic growth, and the encouraging inflation statistics for recent months argued against any near-term policy adjustment.
