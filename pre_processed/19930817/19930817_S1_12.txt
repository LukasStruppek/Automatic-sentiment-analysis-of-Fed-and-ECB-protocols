[" At its meeting on July 6-7, 1993, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that retained a tilt toward possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth of the broader monetary aggregates over the third quarter. "]
