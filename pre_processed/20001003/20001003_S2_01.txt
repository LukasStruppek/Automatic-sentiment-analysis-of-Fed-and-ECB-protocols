The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economic expansion, after slowing considerably from its elevated pace of recent quarters, would be sustained at a rate a little below the staff's current estimate of the economy's potential output. The forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to some extent by the eventual disappearance of positive wealth effects associated with outsized earlier gains in equity prices and by higher interest rates. As a result, growth of spending on consumer durables was expected to remain appreciably below that in recent quarters and housing demand would trend slightly downward. By contrast, business fixed investment, notably outlays for equipment and software, was projected to remain robust, and brisk growth abroad would boost the expansion of U.S. exports for some period ahead. Core consumer price inflation was projected to rise a little over the forecast horizon, in part as a result of higher import prices but largely as a consequence of further increases in nominal labor compensation gains that would not be fully offset by growth in productivity.
