In ratifying these transactions, members emphasized that the action was not intended to signal an increased willingness by the Committee to intervene in foreign exchange markets. In the current instance, the intervention transactions were undertaken in a spirit of cooperation with the international financial community and at the express request of the European Central Bank (ECB). Members commented that historical experience suggested that foreign exchange market interventions generally had not had lasting effects when not accompanied by supporting changes in macroeconomic policies.
