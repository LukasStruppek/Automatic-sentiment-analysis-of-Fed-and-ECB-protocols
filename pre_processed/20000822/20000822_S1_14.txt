In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar increased on net against an index of major currencies, even though interest rate differentials moved against assets denominated in dollars relative to those of other industrial countries. At least in part, the dollar's appreciation reflected heightened market perceptions that economic growth in the United States, though evidently moderating from its rapid pace in recent quarters, was likely to continue to exceed that in most other industrial nations. The foreign exchange value of the dollar dropped slightly against the currencies of other important trading partners, paced by a substantial rise in the value of the Mexican peso in response to brightening political and economic prospects in Mexico.
