Quickening productivity had been the fundamental factor behind the economy's remarkable performance in recent years. Members noted, however, that historical episodes involving major changes in productivity trends had been rare and the past therefore provided a limited basis for evaluating the course of future productivity developments. Accordingly, considerable caution needed to be exercised in assessing the outlook for productivity and in relying on projections of the economy and prices, which necessarily embodied judgments about this outlook, in making monetary policy. Another source of uncertainty related to the interactions of rising productivity and aggregate demand. Over the course of recent years, accelerating productivity gains had tended to boost aggregate demand by even more than potential aggregate supply owing to the effects of stronger profits on investment spending and, through the rising stock market, on consumption as well. However, the leveling out in stock prices this year suggested that recent increases in productivity growth had been built into market expectations and prices some time ago and were not likely to provide the same impetus to demand going forward as had past productivity acceleration. Members cautioned nonetheless that the possibility that long-term interest rates and equity prices did not yet adequately reflect ongoing productivity gains could not be ruled out, with attendant effects boosting demand. Finally, rising productivity clearly had been a major force in containing inflation in a period of unusually low unemployment rates, and while some of the interactions between productivity growth and wages and prices could be adduced, these interactions involved complex processes that were very difficult to assess given the paucity of prior experience. As a consequence, judgments about labor market pressures, productivity, and inflation had to be viewed with care on the basis of evolving developments.
