In the Committee's discussion of the outlook for the economy, members focused considerable attention on the growth rate of the economy's supply potential--its ability to satisfy further growth in demand on a sustainable basis. The widespread application of technological advances and the associated surge in outlays for capital equipment had been fostering an acceleration in labor productivity that seemed to be ongoing. Data on productivity and capital accumulation that had become available in recent months had tended to confirm these trends, and the statistical evidence was reinforced by comments from many business executives and by persistent upward revisions to long-term profit forecasts, which had yet to suggest a leveling out of productivity growth.
