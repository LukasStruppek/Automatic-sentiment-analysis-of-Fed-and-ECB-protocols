In their review of the outlook for expenditures in key sectors of the economy, members observed that growth in consumer spending had moderated substantially after a period of exceptional gains in late 1999 and early 2000. The clearest evidence of softening consumer demand tended to be concentrated in sales of motor vehicles and in housing-related durable goods. Available data on reduced growth in consumer spending were supported by anecdotal reports of some slippage in retail sales below expectations in several parts of the country. Factors underlying these developments included diminishing wealth effects after several months of limited changes in equity prices, the cumulative buildup in the stock of motor vehicles and other consumer durables owned by the public, and the constraining effects of higher energy prices on incomes available to be spent on other goods and services. While these factors might well continue to damp the growth of consumer spending going forward, members noted that consumer confidence remained at a high level, consumer incomes were rising, and no anecdotal or other evidence pointed to any marked deterioration in consumer spending that would pose a potential threat to the sustainability of the economic expansion.
