Industrial production registered further gains in June and July. Persisting strength in manufacturing output was accompanied by brisk increases in mining activity and sizable declines in utilities services associated with cooler-than-normal temperatures. In manufacturing, production of high-tech equipment and most other types of business equipment remained robust, but the manufacture of motor vehicles and parts dropped substantially in July after a small June decline. The further step-up in overall manufacturing activity lifted capacity utilization to a rate around its long-term average.
