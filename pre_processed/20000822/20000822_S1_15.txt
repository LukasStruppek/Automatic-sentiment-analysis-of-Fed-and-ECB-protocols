The growth of domestic nonfinancial debt moderated slightly in the second quarter as a result of an accelerated paydown in federal debt while private borrowing remained brisk. However, partial data for the period since midyear suggested that the overall growth in household and business borrowing might also be slowing somewhat. The expansion of M2 had declined substantially since late spring, apparently in part as a result of the widening opportunity costs of holding assets in M2 stemming from higher market interest rates and possibly also from slackening growth in household incomes. Sluggish currency flows were another contributing factor. At the same time, M3 accelerated in July and partial data pointed to further robust growth in August. The advance in this broader aggregate seemed to be driven by interest-sensitive inflows to M3's institutional money fund component.
