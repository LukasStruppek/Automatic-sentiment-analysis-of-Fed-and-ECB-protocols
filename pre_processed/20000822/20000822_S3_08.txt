In the Committee's discussion of the outlook for inflation, members noted that overall measures of price inflation had picked up to fairly high levels by the standards of recent years, largely as a result of higher energy costs. Moreover, supply factors in major energy markets--petroleum, gas, and electricity generating capacity--did not point to significant relief for some considerable period of time. Still, core consumer price indices remained relatively damped and had risen only a little over the last year, especially when measured by the PCE chain-price index, and that suggested underlying price pressures remained largely contained. Nonetheless, a number of members were concerned that unusually taut labor markets could begin at some point to show through to increases in labor compensation in excess of productivity gains, pressuring unit costs and prices. Evidence of this had yet to emerge, perhaps because productivity continued to accelerate, but a flattening out of the rate of increase in productivity, even at a high level, could well pose at some point a risk to continued favorable inflation performance. To be sure, there were a number of positive factors in the outlook for inflation, including highly competitive conditions in many markets, stable and relatively favorable expectations with regard to the longer-run inflation outlook, and signs that the remarkable acceleration in productivity was continuing. On balance, however, the members saw a mild upward trend in key measures of inflation as a distinct possibility, albeit one that was subject to considerable uncertainty.
