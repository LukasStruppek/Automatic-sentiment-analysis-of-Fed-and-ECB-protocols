In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to retain the current stance of policy, consistent with a federal funds rate continuing to average about 6-1/2 percent. In their assessment of factors leading to this decision, the members focused on the further evidence that moderating demand and accelerating productivity were closing the gap between the growth of aggregate demand and potential supply, even before earlier Committee tightening actions had exerted their full restraining effects. While the recent rally in domestic financial markets could be viewed as having partially eroded the degree of monetary restraint implemented earlier, real interest rates for private borrowers were still at relatively elevated levels, banking institutions were continuing to report further tightening of their standards and terms for business loans, equity prices had risen only modestly, and the dollar had firmed over recent months. In addition, the last few readings on core inflation had not suggested a further upward drift, unit labor costs were not increasing, and longer-term inflation expectations had been stable for some time. Accordingly, the Committee incurred little risk in leaving the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting and waiting to see how the various factors affecting both supply and demand in the economy unfolded and influenced the prospects for economic activity and prices.
