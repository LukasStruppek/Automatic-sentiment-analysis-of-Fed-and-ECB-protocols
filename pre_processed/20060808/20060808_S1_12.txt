Investors anticipated the FOMC's decision at its June meeting to raise the federal funds rate 25 basis points, but near-term policy expectations edged lower, apparently in response to the accompanying statement. Subsequently, data releases on real activity that were weaker than expected, the Chairmans testimony on the semiannual Monetary Policy Report, and the release of the June FOMC minutes all led investors to revise down their expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate. Yields on nominal Treasury securities fell in line with policy expectations over the intermeeting period. Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities declined a bit more than those on comparable nominal Treasury securities, leaving inflation compensation up slightly, albeit within recent ranges. Spreads of yields on corporate bonds over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities were about unchanged, while those on speculative-grade bonds widened. Major stock price indexes rose modestly. The foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies fell, on net, over the intermeeting period.
