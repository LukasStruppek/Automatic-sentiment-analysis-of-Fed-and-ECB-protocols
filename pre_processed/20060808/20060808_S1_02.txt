The information reviewed at the meeting suggested that the growth of economic activity in the second quarter slowed from its rapid pace in the first quarter. Residential investment contracted as activity in the housing market continued to cool. Consumer spending and business investment decelerated after posting substantial increases in the first quarter. The demand for labor moderated, with hiring in recent months below the pace of earlier this year. Consumer price inflation remained elevated in July, reflecting further increases in energy prices and shelter costs.
