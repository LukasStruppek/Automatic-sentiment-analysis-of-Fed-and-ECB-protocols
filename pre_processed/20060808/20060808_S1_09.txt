The U.S. international trade deficit widened in May, reflecting a sharp increase in imports that more than offset a sizable gain in exports. Import growth was heavily concentrated in oil, reflecting both higher prices and quantities; other categories of imports fell on balance. Exports rose across almost all major product categories; the largest gains were in consumer goods and capital goods, especially aircraft. Expansion of economic activity in the advanced foreign economies appeared to continue in the second quarter at a pace roughly comparable to that of the first quarter, on net. Incoming data for the second quarter pointed to a pickup in economic growth in the euro area and Japan but indicated that growth slowed somewhat in Canada. Recent economic indicators from the developing economies were mixed but, in general, suggested some moderation in growth from the rapid first-quarter pace.
