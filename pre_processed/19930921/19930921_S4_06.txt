[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is continuing to expand at a moderate pace. Total nonfarm payroll employment edged down in August after a sizable gain in July, but the average workweek rose to a relatively high level and the civilian unemployment rate declined to 6.7 percent. Industrial production has advanced moderately over recent months. Retail sales changed little in real terms in July and August after increasing appreciably in the second quarter. Housing starts were down slightly in July but rose substantially in August. Available indicators suggest a slowing in the expansion of business capital spending from a robust pace earlier in the year. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was about unchanged in July from its average rate in the second quarter. After rising at an accelerated rate in the early part of the year, consumer prices have increased more slowly and producer prices have fallen in recent months. ']
