[' During the intermeeting period, available members participated in three telephone conference calls to discuss issues relating to the release of information about discussions at Federal Open Market Committee meetings. These calls were prompted by hearings on such issues that were held by the House Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs. The discussions took into account information that unedited transcripts for meetings since early 1976 were maintained by the FOMC secretariat at the Board of Governors. The members did not reach any decisions on these matters during these conferences. In the course of two further telephone conferences during the intermeeting period, the Committee reviewed economic and financial developments affecting Mexico and discussed various contingencies that might involve the Federal Reserve.
