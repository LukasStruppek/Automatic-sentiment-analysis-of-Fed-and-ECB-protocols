[' Many members referred to the more favorable price developments that had occurred since the early part of the year when key measures of inflation had surged. While it was premature to conclude that a distinct disinflationary trend had been re-established, the members generally agreed that price pressures were likely to remain subdued given their projections of some continuing slack in resource utilization. Favorable developments tending to support that conclusion included the persistence of intensely competitive conditions in most markets for goods around the country. The costs of materials purchased by business firms generally were reported to be rising only slowly, if at all. There were indications of fairly tight labor markets in some areas, but wage pressures remained limited even in those markets. At the same time, the costs of worker benefits continued to rise fairly rapidly and many business contacts were expressing concern about the possibility of further mandated cost increases related to the health care reform legislation. For the next several months, relatively rapid increases in food prices associated with weather-related crop losses and an increase in the excise tax on gasoline would tend to boost consumer prices. On balance, these developments were not seen as inconsistent with longer-run progress toward price stability, though the inflation outlook remained subject to considerable uncertainty. ']
