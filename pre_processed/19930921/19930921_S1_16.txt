[" Growth of M2 continued at a slow rate in August. The sluggishness in this aggregate, which occurred despite further rapid expansion in its Ml component, apparently reflected ongoing efforts by households to shift funds away from depository accounts in search of better returns. M3 turned up after declining in June and July; however, expansion of this aggregate continued to be held down by declines in institution-only money market funds. For the year through August, M2 and M3 were estimated to have grown at rates close to the lower ends of the Committee's ranges for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had expanded moderately in recent months, and for the year through July it was estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.
