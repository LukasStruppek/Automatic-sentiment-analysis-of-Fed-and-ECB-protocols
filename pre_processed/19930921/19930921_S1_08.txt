[' Growth in real business fixed investment appeared to be slowing in the third quarter from the robust pace earlier in the year. Shipments of nondefense capital goods dropped substantially in July, with all of the decline occurring in the volatile aircraft component. For capital goods other than aircraft and parts, shipments again moved higher in July; while the demand for computing equipment strengthened after dropping off somewhat in the second quarter, shipments of other types of durable equipment softened. In addition, heavy-truck sales were off substantially in July after advancing steadily since late 1992, and fleet sales of light vehicles were down in July and August. Investment in nonresidential structures posted its largest advance in three years in the second quarter. However, construction activity fell in July in reflection of a sharp decline in the construction of commercial structures other than offices. ']
