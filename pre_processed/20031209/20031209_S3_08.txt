In their review of the outlook for prices, members generally anticipated that persisting, though decreasing, margins of slack in labor and goods markets and further gains in productivity would keep inflation low, with a number of members seeing a small further decline in inflation as a distinct possibility. Even if growth proved fairly robust, downward pressure on prices could come from a narrowing of profit margins, which were currently quite high, or from further surprising strength in productivity, which would reduce labor costs. In addition, some members noted that the current unemployment rate likely understated the slack in labor markets, since the labor market participation rate had fallen significantly of late, and changes in payment and hiring practices had perhaps reduced the level of unemployment that could be sustained without upward pressure on wages. However, with growth now seen as more assured, downward risks to inflation were viewed as considerably reduced relative to earlier in the year, and the risk of a pernicious deflation in which declining prices reinforced weakness in demand - a risk that the members had always viewed as small - was now regarded by most as virtually nil. Indeed, the weaker dollar, higher commodity prices, and outsized increases in benefit costs were seen as suggesting some countervailing upward pressure on costs and prices even though changes in exchange rates and commodity prices generally had not had a large effect on retail prices in the past. Members also expressed concern about the potential for an increase in inflation expectations given highly stimulative macroeconomic policies and economic growth that seemed to be gathering momentum. Some noted that the rise in recent months in inflation compensation, as measured by the difference between the yields on nominal and indexed Treasury securities, could potentially point in this direction. Nonetheless, on balance, most members currently considered the upside risks to inflation to be a bit less pressing than those on the downside for the next few quarters.
