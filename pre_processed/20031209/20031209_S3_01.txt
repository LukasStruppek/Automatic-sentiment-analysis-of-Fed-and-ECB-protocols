In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to widespread indications that the pickup in the economic expansion was broadening and becoming more entrenched. The members noted that spending by households had remained strong even as the effects of tax cuts and mortgage refinancing began to wane. And with business confidence on the mend, investment outlays had increased rapidly and employment had revived. While assessments by individual members of the likely pace of the expansion going forward differed somewhat, they generally expected growth to run at a rate that would trim slack in labor and goods markets over the forecast period, assuming no major shocks to the economy. Factors supporting this view included stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, accommodative conditions in financial markets, building business confidence, a rebound in profits, and the effects on the external sector of the weaker dollar and pickup in growth abroad. While downside risks to the outlook had diminished, some members remained concerned that spending could slow somewhat next year as the effects of fiscal stimulus and mortgage refinancing faded. Rapid productivity growth also could limit employment gains and so weigh on consumer confidence. With relatively strong economic growth nonetheless seemingly more assured, members regarded the risks to inflation as more nearly balanced than earlier in the year.
