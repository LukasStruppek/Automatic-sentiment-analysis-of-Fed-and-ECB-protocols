Views differed with regard to the reference in recent statements to maintaining an accommodative monetary policy "for a considerable period." A number of members argued that its deletion would serve to enhance the Committee's flexibility to adjust monetary policy at a later date when that was deemed appropriate on the basis of evolving economic circumstances. A majority, however, preferred to retain the phrase, at least for now. They noted that the changes in their assessment of risk would convey the evolving views of the Committee and they believed the "considerable period" reference still accurately conveyed the Committee's policy intentions. Given the decision to retain the reference in question, all the members saw merit in associating it more clearly with economic conditions, specifically the persistence of quite low inflation and slack in resource use, as opposed to having it appear to be linked only to the passage of time.
