The exchange value of the dollar, as measured by the major currencies index, declined somewhat, on net, over the intermeeting period. The dollar had appreciated in late October and early November following several stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data releases. But the dollar depreciated, on net, over the remainder of the intermeeting period, reflecting concerns about an escalation of trade frictions prompted by the U.S. imposition of import quotas on Chinese textiles, the ability of the United States to continue to finance its current account deficit, and risks stemming from developments in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Turkey.
