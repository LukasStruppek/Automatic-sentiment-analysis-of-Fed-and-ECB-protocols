At this meeting Mr. Ferguson reported on the progress of the working group that was charged at the October 28 meeting with developing some specific proposals regarding how best to communicate the Committee's assessment of the outlook for economic activity and inflation. The working group had solicited and received comments from the members of the Board of Governors and from the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks regarding potential approaches for improving communications with the public and enhancing thereby the latter's understanding of monetary policy decisions. It was agreed that the working group, with the assistance of staff at the Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Banks, would prepare more detailed proposals together with supporting staff documentation for consideration at a later meeting of the Committee.
