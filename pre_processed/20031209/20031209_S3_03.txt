In their comments about the outlook for demand in key sectors of the economy, members indicated greater confidence that the sizable gains in business spending in recent quarters would continue. It now appeared that the increase in outlays for equipment and software in the third quarter was even larger than had been thought, and data on orders and shipments, as well as anecdotal reports, pointed to further increases. These gains owed to rising business confidence, substantial gains in profits and cash flow, and accommodative financial markets. In addition, businesses were expected to step up investment outlays next year in advance of the expiration of temporary tax incentives. Some members noted that the commercial real estate sector, which had been very weak with high vacancy rates and falling rents, was showing signs of bottoming, as the strengthening economy boosted demand for office and retail space.
