Real nonfarm inventories fell moderately in the third quarter after declining substantially in the second. Manufacturers liquidated stocks by a larger amount in the third quarter than in the previous quarter but added slightly to their inventories in October. Wholesalers and retailers (excluding those selling motor vehicles and parts) built up inventories in the third quarter, and, for wholesalers, the stockbuilding continued in October (data on retail inventories in October were unavailable). Still, inventory-sales ratios in all three categories declined a bit further in the third quarter from already very low levels.
