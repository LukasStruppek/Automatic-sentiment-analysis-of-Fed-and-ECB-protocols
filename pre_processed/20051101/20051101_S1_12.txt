At its September meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 3Ĺž percent. In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. The Committee noted that the widespread devastation in the Gulf region from Hurricane Katrina, the associated dislocation of economic activity, and the boost to energy prices would set back spending, production, and employment in the near term. However, the Committee judged that these unfortunate developments did not pose a more persistent threat to the overall economy. Rather, monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, was providing ongoing support to economic activity. Although higher energy and other costs had the potential to add to inflation pressure, core inflation had been relatively low in the preceding few months and longer-term inflation expectations remained contained. In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.
