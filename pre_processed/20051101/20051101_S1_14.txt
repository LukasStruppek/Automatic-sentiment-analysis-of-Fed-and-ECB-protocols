Domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have advanced briskly in the third quarter. Growth in household debt was estimated to have edged down in the third quarter because of a slowing in mortgage debt growth but remained elevated. Household bankruptcies surged in the weeks immediately before bankruptcy reforms went into effect on October 17. The debt of nonfinancial businesses rose in the third quarter at a rate comparable to the increases seen in the first half of the year. Bank loans to businesses continued to advance briskly, and the results of the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey showed some further easing of lending terms and standards for such loans. M2 expanded at a fairly solid rate in September. The increase in September was in part attributable to a boost to currency and liquid deposits resulting from Hurricane Katrina. Growth in nominal output in the third quarter exceeded that of M2, implying a further rise in velocity.
