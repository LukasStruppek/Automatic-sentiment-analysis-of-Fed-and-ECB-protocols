Payroll employment fell in September, held down by substantial job losses associated with Hurricane Katrina. Employment in the areas unaffected by the hurricane increased at a rate in line with the average pace over the previous twelve months. The largest employment loss occurred in the leisure and hospitality category, an industry particularly hard hit by the storm. The average workweek was unchanged in September, so with employment lower, aggregate hours declined slightly. The unemployment rate rose 0.2 percentage points to 5.1 percent. The labor force participation rate held steady, but the number of individuals reporting that they had a job but were not at work because of bad weather surged. More recently, weekly data on initial claims for unemployment insurance suggested that the job losses associated with the hurricane were subsiding.
