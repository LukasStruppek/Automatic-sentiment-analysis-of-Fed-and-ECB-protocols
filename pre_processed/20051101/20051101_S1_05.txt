Industrial production fell substantially in September, but excluding the effects of hurricane-related disturbances and the Boeing strike, industrial production was estimated to have risen at a brisk pace. The hurricanes caused the index for oil and natural gas extraction and refining to plummet in September, and they also significantly affected petrochemical production. Manufacturing output fell noticeably in the shipbuilding, food manufacturing, paper, and plywood industries. In the transportation equipment category, motor vehicle production climbed notably, but the machinists' strike at Boeing caused the company to cease nearly all commercial aircraft production during the month. High-tech output--led by strong gains in the production of semiconductors and communications equipment--surged in September. Manufacturing capacity utilization dropped substantially in September, but was still noticeably above its year-earlier level.
