Total business inventories rose considerably in March, mostly reflecting a huge run-up in inventories at automotive dealerships. For the first quarter as a whole, inventory accumulation exclusive of motor vehicles was near the subdued pace of late 1998, and stocks generally appeared to be at fairly low levels relative to sales. In the manufacturing sector, inventories fell further in the first quarter, largely reflecting reductions of stocks of aircraft and parts, and the aggregate inventory-sales ratio for the sector in March was somewhat below the bottom of its range over the previous twelve months. The first-quarter rise in non-auto wholesale inventories was nearly the same as the fourth-quarter increase. With sales up appreciably, however, the inventory-sales ratio for the sector dropped sharply and was near the bottom of its range for the past year. Non-auto retail inventories increased considerably in the first quarter, but sales grew by even more and the aggregate inventory-sales ratio was near the bottom of its range over the last year.
