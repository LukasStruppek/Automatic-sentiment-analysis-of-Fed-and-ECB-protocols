The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had continued to expand vigorously. Consumer spending had maintained its strong forward momentum, and housing activity generally had remained at a high level. Growth of business capital spending had slowed appreciably but was still quite rapid. The expansion in industrial production had quickened recently while gains in employment had moderated somewhat. Inflation had remained low, although consumer prices registered a sizable rise in April; labor costs were still quiescent despite very tight labor markets.
