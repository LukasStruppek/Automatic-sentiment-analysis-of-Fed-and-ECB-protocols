Total housing starts fell in April after several months of unusually favorable weather conditions that had allowed builders to maintain a relatively high level of construction activity. Some of the decline in starts apparently reflected shortages of labor and some types of building materials. However, sales of new homes had fallen somewhat on balance thus far this year, and applications for mortgages to finance purchases of homes remained below their 1998 peak despite a recent turn upward.
