The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would gradually moderate to a rate commensurate with the rise in the economy's estimated potential. Growth of private final demand would be damped by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects stemming from large increases in equity prices and by slower growth of spending on consumer durables, houses, and business equipment after the earlier buildup in the stocks of these items. The lagged effects of the rise that had occurred in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, though diminishing, restraint on the demand for U.S. exports for some period ahead. Labor markets were anticipated to remain tight, and inflation was projected to increase somewhat on balance over the projection period, partly as a result of some firming of import prices that, in turn, would give domestic firms somewhat more leeway to raise their prices.
