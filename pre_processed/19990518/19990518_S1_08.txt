Consumer spending has been very strong this year, supported by rapid income growth, soaring household net worth, and buoyant consumer sentiment. Retail sales edged still higher in April after recording large gains earlier in the year. Sales of motor vehicles in April again were exceptionally high, and outlays for non-auto goods remained robust. In addition, spending on services grew briskly in the first quarter (latest data available), paced by sharply increased outlays for energy, bank and brokerage services, and recreation.
