In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that they saw few signs of any moderation in the expansion of economic activity from the rapid pace that had prevailed in recent quarters-a pace greater than the growth in the economy's potential, even though the growth of potential was rising as a result of accelerating productivity. For a number of reasons, they still viewed some slowing in the expansion to a growth rate more in line with that of potential as a reasonable expectation. However, the timing and extent of the moderation remained subject to substantial uncertainty. And in light of the persistent strength in domestic demand, the reduced risks of economic weakness abroad, and the recovery in U.S. financial markets, most members believed that for the year ahead the odds around their forecasts were tilted toward further robust growth that would add to pressures on already tight labor markets. The latest statistical and anecdotal information on wages and prices, while somewhat more mixed than earlier, continued on balance to present a picture of benign inflation. However, the firming of oil and other commodity prices, the more frequent anecdotal reports of increases in some costs and prices, and the most recent CPI statistics could be read as suggesting at least that the trend toward lower inflation was coming to an end and perhaps also as harbingers of a less favorable inflation performance going forward, especially if growth in demand did not slow to a more sustainable pace. A key uncertainty in the outlook for inflation related to the prospects for productivity, whose continued acceleration over the past several quarters clearly had helped to contain cost pressures despite widespread indications of persistently tight labor markets. On balance, while an upward trend in underlying inflation had not materialized thus far, the members were concerned that if recent developments continued--especially if demand did not slow to a more sustainable pace--inflation was more likely to rise over time.
