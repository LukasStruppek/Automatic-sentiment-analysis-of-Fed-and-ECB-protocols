Growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed on balance over March and April, but hiring was still relatively rapid. Employment gains were concentrated in the services, retail trade, and finance, insurance, and real estate categories. By contrast, manufacturing experienced further job losses, and construction employment fell on balance over the March-April period after having expanded briskly since last fall. The civilian unemployment rate in April, at 4.3 percent, matched its first-quarter average.
