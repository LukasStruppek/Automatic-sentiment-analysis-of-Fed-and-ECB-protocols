Consumer spending advanced strongly in the third quarter from the sluggish pace of the second quarter. The acceleration reflected a surge in expenditures on motor vehicles that owed partly to attractive incentives, but spending on other durables and nondurables was also up. Spending on services was steady for the third quarter on average, but advanced in September on a boost to electricity consumption related to unseasonably warm weather. Real disposable income slowed in the third quarter to a moderate pace and was flat in September, probably in part because of effects of the hurricanes. Measures of consumer confidence moved down in September and again in October. Activity in housing markets remained generally strong in September, supported by favorable mortgage rates. Although starts of single-family homes slowed to well below the level of preceding months, multifamily starts rose and sales of both existing and new homes were elevated.
