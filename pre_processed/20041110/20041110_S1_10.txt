The U.S. international trade deficit rose in the third quarter on average, reflecting some weakening in the growth of service exports and an increase in the price and quantity of petroleum imports. The deficit narrowed in September, however, as imports fell while exports expanded moderately. The lower level of imports in September mainly reflected declines in the petroleum and services categories. Economic expansion abroad on average appeared to slow in the third quarter, although it remained solid.
