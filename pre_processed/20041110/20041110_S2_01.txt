In the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, the economy was seen as likely to expand next year at around this yearÂs solid pace under an assumption of generally accommodative financial conditions. Recent declines in the dollar were expected to support domestic economic activity by boosting net exports. Fiscal policy was expected to become much less stimulative after the current quarter, owing to the expiration of the temporary partial-expensing provisions of the tax code. Oil prices were anticipated to decline somewhat with the repair of hurricane-related damage to oil infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to some slowing in inflation. With the economy expected to advance over the coming year at a rate a bit above its longer-run potential, the pace of hiring should firm and the unemployment rate should edge lower. In response to rising real incomes, consumer spending was forecast to strengthen after the early part of next year. The staff expected business investment spending to slow sharply early next year as partial-expensing provisions expired, but then to pick up noticeably in response to favorable financing conditions, ample business liquidity, and the need to replace or upgrade aging equipment and software.
