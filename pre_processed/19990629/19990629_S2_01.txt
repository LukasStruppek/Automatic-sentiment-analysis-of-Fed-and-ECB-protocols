The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would gradually moderate to a rate commensurate with the growth of the economy's estimated potential. The lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, though diminishing, restraint on the demand for U.S. exports for some period ahead. The increase of private final demand would be restrained by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects associated with earlier large increases in equity prices; by slower growth of spending on consumer durables, houses, and business equipment in the wake of the prolonged buildup in the stocks of these items; and by the rise that had already occurred in market interest rates, especially for intermediate and longer maturities, in the expectation that higher interest rates would be needed to achieve a better balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Price inflation was projected to rise somewhat over the projection horizon, in large part as a result of some upturn in import prices and a slight firming of gains in nominal labor compensation that would not be fully offset by rising productivity.
