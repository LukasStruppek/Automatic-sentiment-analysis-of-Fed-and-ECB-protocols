Industrial production advanced somewhat further in May despite a sharp weather-related drop in utility services and continued sluggishness in mining activity. Manufacturing output registered another substantial advance, reflecting a surge in the production of motor vehicles and parts and persisting strength in the manufacture of many other durable goods. The output of nondurable goods posted another small increase in May, with the gains being fairly broadly based. Reflecting the stepped-up pace of manufacturing, the rate of utilization of capacity edged higher in May but continued to be below its long-run average level.
