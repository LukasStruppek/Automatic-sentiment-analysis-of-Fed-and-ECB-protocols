Key factors underlying the members' forecasts of appreciable moderation in the trend of real GDP growth included a waning of the financial stimulus that had boosted domestic demand in recent years and the buildup of stocks of consumer durables, housing, and business equipment after an extended period of rapidly expanding purchases. The members acknowledged that the signs of slower growth in household and business spending were still quite limited. In the household sector, further substantial increases in income and financial wealth and high levels of consumer confidence had fostered continued robust growth in consumer spending in recent months, but apart from exceptional strength in purchases of motor vehicles, growth in real spending for durable consumer goods appeared to have moderated recently from a very rapid pace earlier in the year. How long the favorable factors that continued to stimulate substantial growth in consumer expenditures would persist was uncertain, notably with regard to the outlook for stock market prices and their effects on consumer resources and willingness to spend. The stimulus to household spending from rapidly rising stock market wealth obviously would diminish should prices in the stock market tend to level out as many expected. In that event, growth in consumer spending might be expected to moderate to a pace more in line with the expansion in disposable incomes.
