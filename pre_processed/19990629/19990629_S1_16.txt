After recording sizable increases in April that apparently were associated with tax-related buildups in liquid accounts, the growth of M2 and M3 slowed sharply in May, as tax payments cleared, and appeared to have remained moderate in June. The expansion of these aggregates also seemed to have been damped in recent months by the rise in their opportunity costs associated with earlier increases in interest rates. M2 was estimated to have increased for the year through June at a rate somewhat above the Committee's annual range and M3 at a rate near the upper end of its range. Although growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had moderated a little recently, it continued to expand at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range.
