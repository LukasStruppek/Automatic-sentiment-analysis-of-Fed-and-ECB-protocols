In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all but one member supported a proposal for a slight tightening of conditions in reserve markets consistent with an increase of 0.25 percentage point in the federal funds rate to an average of around 5 percent. In the view of most members, such a policy move represented a desirable and cautious preemptive step in the direction of reducing what they saw as a significant risk of rising inflation. While current indications of accelerating inflation were quite limited, the economy had been expanding rapidly enough to put added pressure on labor markets over time, and many members expressed growing concern that, given the current stance of monetary policy, the persisting strength of domestic demand augmented by increasing demand from abroad would show through at some point to even tighter labor markets and higher inflation, which would impinge over time on the economy's ability to realize its full growth potential. In these circumstances, a small preemptive move at this time would provide a degree of insurance against worsening inflation later. Members commented that the action in question would reverse a portion of the easing actions implemented during the fall of 1998 that had been undertaken in part to protect against the possibility that unsettled global markets would place even greater constraints on foreign and domestic economic activity than were then evident. As financial markets and foreign economies stabilized and recovered, that added protection was no longer required and policy needed to move to a less accommodative stance to promote sustainable growth in spending. One member did not agree that any tightening of policy was necessary to contain inflation, given the persistence of low inflation, accelerating productivity, and what in his view was an already sufficiently restrictive monetary policy stance.
