In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar edged up over the intermeeting period in relation to the currencies of a broad group of important U.S. trading partners. The dollar appreciated against the euro, partly reflecting the contrast between continuing robust growth in the United States and generally sub-par activity in euro-area economies. The dollar also rose against the pound in association with slower growth in the United Kingdom and a reduction in the Bank of England's repo rate. By contrast, the dollar weakened against the yen as yields on Japanese government debt increased sharply relative to rates on U.S. Treasury securities. Among other important trading partners, the dollar fell against the currencies of many emerging Asian economies, whose financial markets had generally improved, but appreciated in terms of the Brazilian real in association with periods of particular stress in Brazil's financial markets.
