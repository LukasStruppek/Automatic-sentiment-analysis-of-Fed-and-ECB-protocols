Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further on balance in April and May, but the increase was a little below the rate for the first quarter. Growth in employment remained robust in the service-producing sector in the April-May period, but the number of jobs fell in the goods-producing sector: payrolls in manufacturing and mining continued to contract, and construction employment changed little on net after a sizable first-quarter increase. The civilian unemployment rate edged down in May to 4.2 percent, matching its low for the year and for the period since 1970.
