At its meeting on May 18, 1999, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that would be consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 4-3/4 percent, but the directive also contained a bias toward a possible tightening of policy. The members' concerns about inflation had increased appreciably since the meeting in late March, but the members nonetheless felt that the current stance of policy could remain consistent with subdued inflation for some time, especially if productivity gains continued robust and, as projected, the growth of aggregate demand moderated somewhat in the months ahead.
