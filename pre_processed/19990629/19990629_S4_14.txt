Members who preferred to retain an asymmetrical directive agreed that, although there was little likelihood of a further policy change during the intermeeting period, such a directive was the best way to convey their concerns about the risks of rising inflation and the potential need for policy tightening over time. A number of those in favor of asymmetry were concerned that a symmetrical directive would not capture the Committee's thinking with regard to the most likely policy course over an extended period of time and could foster the misleading conclusion that the Committee no longer believed a further adjustment to policy might be warranted at some point later this year. They saw the odds as reasonably high that further tightening would be needed before the end of the year to gain adequate assurance that inflation would be contained. Despite their differing preferences, all the members who supported a policy tightening move also indicated that they could accept a symmetrical directive because the announcement to be released after this meeting along with the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony during the latter part of July could serve to correct possible misinterpretations.
