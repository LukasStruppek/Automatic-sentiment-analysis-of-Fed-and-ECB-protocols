In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contem plated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from April through June at annual rates of about 2-1/2 and 1-1/2 percent, respectively.
