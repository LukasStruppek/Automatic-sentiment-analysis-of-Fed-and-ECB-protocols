[' Consumer prices had risen more slowly on balance in recent months than they had during the first half of the year. In November, the total index for consumer prices was unchanged, and consumer prices excluding food and energy were up only slightly. In contrast, producer prices of finished goods registered a relatively large increase in November, and the component of this index excluding food and energy posted its largest rise since January. At the same time, prices of intermediate materials declined a bit further in November. According to recent survey results, consumers now expected less inflation over the year ahead and also over the next five to ten years. The available data on wages and worker benefits continued on balance to display a relatively subdued trend of increases in labor compensation. ']
