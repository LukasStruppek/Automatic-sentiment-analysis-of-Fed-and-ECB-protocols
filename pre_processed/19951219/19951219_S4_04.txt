[" At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the members indicated that they favored or could support a directive that called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure on reserve conditions during the intermeeting period but that contained no presumption about the likely direction of any intermeeting policy change. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser monetary restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. A staff analysis indicated that the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over coming months. "]
