[' Business fixed investment was continuing to grow at a rapid pace, with much of the strength stemming from the persisting and vigorous expansion in spending for office and computing equipment. However, the recent gains in total business investment had moderated from the extraordinary pace evident in 1994 and early 1995, and they also were less widespread among major categories of business equipment than they had been earlier. New orders for nondefense capital goods other than computers and aircraft had leveled out, although shipments were being maintained at high levels by still-large backlogs of unfilled orders. Producers of aircraft had received very sizable new orders recently, but shipments of completed aircraft had been held back in recent months by the strike at a major firm. Outlays for nonresidential construction were continuing to advance briskly, with construction of commercial structures posting sizable increases recently. Overall drilling and mining activity also had continued to move higher, led by increased exploration for natural gas. ']
