[' Industrial production was little changed on balance over October and November after a sizable increase in the third quarter. A decline in October was largely accounted for by a strike at a major aircraft manufacturer and that strike, very recently settled, had also exerted a slightly depressing effect on production in November. Production of motor vehicles and parts also fell, on net, in October and November. Further growth outside the aircraft and motor vehicle industries was paced by continuing strength in the production of business equipment. Outside manufacturing, the output of utilities was boosted in November by demand associated with unusually cold weather. ']
