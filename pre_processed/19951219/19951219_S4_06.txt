[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a substantial slowing in the expansion of economic activity after a strong gain in the third quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment increased further in November, but the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 5.6 percent. Industrial production was little changed on average over October and November after a moderate rise in the third quarter. Total nominal retail sales rose somewhat on balance over October and November. Housing starts were down in October after a large increase in the third quarter. However, orders for nondefense capital goods point to substantial expansion of spending on business equipment in the near term, and nonresidential construction has risen appreciably further. Wage trends have been stable and consumer prices have risen relatively slowly on average in recent months. ']
