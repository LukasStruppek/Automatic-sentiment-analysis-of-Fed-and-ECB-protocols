[' The information available at this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity had slowed substantially after a strong gain in such activity during the third quarter. Data on employment and aggregate hours worked since late summer were consistent with moderate further increases in overall economic activity. Industrial production had changed little on balance after a sizable rise in the third quarter. On the spending side, robust advances in business fixed investment continued to provide considerable impetus to the economy. The available information on consumer expenditures pointed to somewhat reduced gains in recent months, and indicators of housing demand suggested on balance that activity in housing markets had tended to stabilize after several months of considerable strengthening. Consumer prices had risen relatively slowly in recent months, while increases in labor compensation had remained comparatively subdued. ']
