[' Data for October indicated a sizable accumulation of business inventories. In manufacturing, stocks grew at a rate only moderately below the brisk pace in the third quarter, and the rise continued to be concentrated in the capital goods industries. The aggregate ratio of inventories to sales in manufacturing was somewhat above the lows in late 1994 and early 1995. In the wholesale sector, a buildup in stocks of capital equipment accounted for the bulk of the accumulation in October, and the inventory-to-sales ratio in this sector remained on an uptrend. A sharp rise in retail inventories in October was led by a large increase in stocks at auto dealers and at general merchandise and apparel outlets. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector as a whole was at its high for the year, but signs of overstocking, apart from motor vehicles, were limited. ']
