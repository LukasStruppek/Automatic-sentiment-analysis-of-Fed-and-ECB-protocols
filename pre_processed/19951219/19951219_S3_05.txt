[' The outlook for fiscal policy continued to be clouded by the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the debate between the Congress and the Administration. The members anticipated that the result of the debate would be considerable fiscal restraint, but the timing of tax and spending initiatives aimed at an eventual balancing of the budget and the extent of the fiscal contraction over time could not be forecast with any precision. In the interim, much of the federal government was closed, and while federal workers were expected to get paid eventually, their spending and that of federal contractors might be damped until the situation was resolved. The members believed, however, that in light of the plans being put forward, the fiscal drag imposed by likely federal budget developments would not be unusually large over the next few years. ']
