[" In the Committee's discussion of regional developments, members reported that anecdotal and other information pertaining to regional activity suggested that the moderation in nationwide economic growth was evident across most of the nation, with the rate of expansion ranging from slow to moderate in different areas of the country. Overall levels of business activity continued to vary widely, from relatively weak in some areas to comparatively robust in others. Conditions also were uneven across industries, particularly in manufacturing, where flagging auto sales and some further inventory accumulation contrasted sharply with brisk demand for a range of producers durable goods, notably office and computing equipment, and building products. Despite indications that job growth had been relatively limited, labor markets remained tight in many parts of the country and there were more, albeit still limited, reports of rising wage pressures; in some areas, however, labor market conditions appeared to have eased somewhat recently.
