[' Changes in producer and consumer prices were small in May following sizable increases earlier in the year. Producer prices of finished goods were unchanged in May, as declines in prices of finished consumer food and energy products offset small advances in prices of other finished goods. Excluding the food and energy components, producer prices had risen more rapidly thus far in 1993 than they had in the second half of 1992. At the consumer level, prices of items other than food and energy rose only slightly in May, but this measure of inflation also had risen faster this year than in the second half of last year. Labor costs likewise had evidenced a quickened pace of increases this year. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers rose substantially in May after edging lower in April, and these earnings had grown more rapidly over the first five months of 1993 than over the preceding six months.
