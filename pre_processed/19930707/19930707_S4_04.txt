[" A majority of the members, taking account of the current stance of monetary policy, favored a proposal to retain the bias toward possible tightening that the Committee had adopted at the May meeting. In this connection, some commented that while the need for any policy adjustment during the period ahead seemed somewhat remote, the next policy move was more likely to be in the direction of some firming than toward easing. Other members suggested that a symmetrical directive might be more consistent with current economic conditions and the related outlook for a steady policy course over the near term. These members agreed, however, that a return to symmetry so soon after the adoption of a directive that was biased toward restraint could convey a misleading impression that recent developments had increased the Committee's concerns about the sustainability of the expansion or that the Committee had become less committed to a disinflationary policy course. Accordingly, these members indicated that they could support an asymmetric directive at this point. Several members observed that a number of key economic measures were scheduled for release during the intermeeting period and that the data in question should provide a firmer basis for evaluating the performance of the economy and a desirable course for monetary policy.
