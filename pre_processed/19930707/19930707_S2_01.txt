[' The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested moderate growth in economic activity and modest reductions in margins of unemployed labor and capital through 1994. The projection assumed the enactment of a federal budget bill that implied a moderately restrictive fiscal policy over the forecast horizon. As in earlier staff projections, lower interest rates were expected to support appreciable gains in interest-sensitive expenditures, including housing, consumer durables, and business equipment. Private spending also would be buttressed by a favorable financial environment associated with strengthened balance sheets and reduced debt burdens and by the apparently increasing willingness of banking institutions to make new loans. Export demand was likely to remain constrained over the near term by the weakness in the economies of several major industrial countries, but some improvement in foreign demand was anticipated later as those economies started to strengthen. The outlook for moderate growth and continuing slack in resource utilization suggested considerably more subdued price increases than had occurred in the early months of 1993. ']
