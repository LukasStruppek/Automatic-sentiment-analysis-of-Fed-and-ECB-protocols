[' In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies increased on balance over the intermeeting period. After depreciating somewhat through the end of May, the dollar recovered in early June when U.S. money market interest rates moved higher. The dollar rose more strongly over the last half of June, principally in response to actual and expected monetary easing abroad. The rise in the dollar over the intermeeting interval reflected sizable appreciations against European currencies, especially the German mark. The dollar continued to fall against the Japanese yen through the middle of June, in the process setting several new lows, before recovering a little over the remainder of the period. ']
