[' According to a staff analysis prepared for this meeting, the growth of M2 could be expected to slow markedly in the months ahead from its pace over the second quarter. The projected deceleration was mainly associated with some unwinding of the second-quarter bulge in mortgage refinancings along with further heavy inflows to bond and stock mutual funds. The expansion of M3 appeared likely to be held down by weaker bank credit extensions as alternative sources of funds in the capital markets attracted more borrowers. On balance, modest growth of both M2 and M3 would keep them close to the lower ends of their downward-revised ranges through September. ']
