[' In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth in the monetary and debt aggregates that it had established in February for 1993 and it decided on tentative ranges for growth in those aggregates in 1994. The current ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993 included expansion of 2 to 6 percent for M2 and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for M3. A monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had been set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for 1993. ']
