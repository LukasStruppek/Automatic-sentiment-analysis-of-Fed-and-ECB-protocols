[' Turning to the outlook for individual sectors of the economy, members referred to indications of an upturn in consumer spending in recent months, but they also noted that survey results and anecdotal reports still suggested generally cautious consumer attitudes. The prospects for increased taxes might be having some negative effect on consumer confidence, but consumers remained especially concerned about the outlook for jobs and incomes as defense cutbacks continued and many firms, notably larger business establishments, took further steps to restructure and downsize their operations. To an important extent the improvement in retail sales in the second quarter was associated with stronger sales of motor vehicles that, in the view of at least some members, appeared to reflect previously postponed replacement demand rather than a major shift in consumer attitudes. In any event, moderate growth in consumer spending was likely to be maintained in the context of the improved financial condition and the related reduction in debt-service burdens of many households. Further growth in overall employment, in line with that achieved in the first half of the year, would if it persisted provide important support toward sustaining the expansion of consumer spending and thus the growth of the economy more generally.
