[' Some members cautioned that despite the very sluggish behavior of the broad measures of money thus far this year, monetary policy was relatively expansive as evidenced by a variety of other indicators including the growth in narrow measures of money and reserves and the very low levels of money market interest rates. Indeed, in the view of several members, in a period characterized by indications of some worsening in inflationary expectations, a policy course that maintained steady conditions in reserve markets could be said to have become more accommodative as the federal funds rate, in real terms after adjustment for expected inflation, moved down from an already low level. Accordingly, while current monetary policy seemed likely to support further economic-expansion, the Committee needed to remain alert to the potential for intensifying inflation. At some point the current policy stance could well begin to foster greater price pressures. One member urged a prompt move toward restraint, given the prospect in his view that further progress toward price stability was unlikely with the current, quite stimulative, stance of monetary policy.
