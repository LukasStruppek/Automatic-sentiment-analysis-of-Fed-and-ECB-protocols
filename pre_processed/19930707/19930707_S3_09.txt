[" In the Committee's discussion, the members focused on the issue of whether or not to lower the ranges further. In February, the ranges for M2 and M3 had been reduced by 1/2 percentage point in the expectation that continuing rechanneling of credit demands and savings flows into securities markets and away from depository institutions would result in further increases in velocity, the ratio of nominal GDP to monetary measures such as M2 or M3. In fact, the strength of these forces was underestimated to some extent. Substantial increases occurred in the velocity of both M2 and M3, especially in the first quarter, that were reflected in weak bank credit and huge inflows into bond and stock mutual funds. In the circumstances, the expansion of both aggregates through midyear was below the lower ends of the reduced ranges established by the Committee for the year. According to a staff analysis, the developments boosting M2 and M3 velocity could be expected to persist over the balance of 1993. Such an outcome would imply monetary growth for the year as a whole slightly below the Committee's current ranges, even if the growth of nominal GDP picked up in the second half of the year as implied by the central tendency of the members' forecasts.
