[' Business inventories recorded another appreciable rise in April, and available data pointed to a further increase in May. In manufacturing, inventory accumulation stepped up in April and May after changing little in the first quarter: the ratio of stocks to shipments edged higher in each month and was only slightly above the very low level reached early in 1993. In the wholesale trade sector, inventories advanced at a slower rate in May than in April, and the inventory-to-sales ratio fell to the low end of the range for the past three years. The buildup of retail inventories slowed considerably in April, and with sales rebounding from the effect of March storms, the inventory-to-sales ratio declined for the retail sector. Nonetheless, the ratio still was near the high end of its range for the past several years. ']
