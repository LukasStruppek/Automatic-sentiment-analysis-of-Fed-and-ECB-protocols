[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the economic expansion has picked up somewhat in recent months from the very slow pace of the first quarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment changed little in June after registering substantial gains in April and May, and the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 7.0 percent in June. Industrial production has changed little on balance over the last few months. Real consumer expenditures edged higher in May after a sizable rise in April but have increased only slightly thus far this year. Housing starts turned up in April from a depressed first-quarter pace and rose somewhat further in May. Incoming data suggest a continued brisk advance in outlays for business equipment, while nonresidential construction has remained soft. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was about unchanged in April but substantially larger than its average rate in the first quarter. Consumer and producer prices were about unchanged in May, but for the year to date inflation has been more rapid than in the second half of 1992. ']
