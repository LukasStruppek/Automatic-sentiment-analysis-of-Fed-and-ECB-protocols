Incoming data and reports from businesses suggested that the labor market remained tight. The unemployment rate had moved slightly lower on balance over recent months, and many business contacts reported difficulties in recruiting suitably qualified workers, especially for certain types of professional and skilled positions. The downward revision to the estimated increases in labor compensation and unit labor costs earlier in the year had eased some participants' concerns about the extent of the pressures on labor resources. Nonetheless, the possibility that the tightness of the labor market could lead to sustained upward pressure on nominal labor costs was viewed as an upside risk to the expected moderation in inflation.
