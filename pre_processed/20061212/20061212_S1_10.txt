The U.S. international trade deficit declined in September from a record level in August. The narrowing primarily reflected a sharp falloff in the value of imported oil, although non-oil imports, including industrial supplies, capital goods, and automotive products, also declined. Export growth in September was led by aircraft and industrial supplies, while exports of automotive products, consumer goods, and semiconductors fell. The trade deficit shrank a bit further in October.
