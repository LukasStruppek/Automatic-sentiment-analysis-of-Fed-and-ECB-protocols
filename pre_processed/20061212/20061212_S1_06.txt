Real consumer spending increased strongly in October after a more modest gain in September. Although purchases of motor vehicles weakened in October, outlays on a broad range of other categories of goods, including gasoline, food, and apparel, rose briskly. Spurred by sharp declines in consumer energy prices, real disposable income also increased rapidly in September and October. Despite the further deceleration in house prices, the ratio of household wealth to disposable income remained well above its historical average, buoyed by robust gains in the stock market. Readings on consumer sentiment edged down in November and early December but stayed above levels seen in the summer.
