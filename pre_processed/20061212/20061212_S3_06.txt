The slowing in the pace of economic expansion in recent quarters evidenced by the business spending data was also apparent in measures of industrial production. Much of the slowing in production had been concentrated in the motor vehicle sector--as producers had cut assemblies in order to reduce high inventory levels--and in construction-related sectors. But, more recently, inventories had increased in a number of other sectors, and manufacturing production had been trimmed in response. Further adjustments remained possible, suggesting an additional source of downside risk to economic growth in the near term. In contrast, indicators of activity in the services sector implied continued brisk growth.
