The staff forecast prepared for this meeting emphasized the continuing wide range of uncertainty surrounding the outlook in the wake of the September attacks. The mild downturn in economic activity in the third quarter was seen as likely to deepen over the remainder of the year and to continue for a time next year. However, the cumulative easing that had occurred in the stance of monetary policy, coupled with the fiscal stimulus already in place and prospective additional measures, would provide support for economic activity. Moreover, the ongoing liquidation of inventories would eventually abate and give a sizable boost to production, while an expected pickup in foreign economies would provide some support for U.S. exports. As a result, economic expansion was projected to resume and gradually gain strength through 2003, reaching a rate around the staff's current estimate of the growth of the economy's potential output. The period of sub-par expansion was expected to foster an appreciable easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation.
