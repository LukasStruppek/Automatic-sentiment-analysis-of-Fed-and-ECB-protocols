The considerable slack in labor markets, evidenced by both statistical and widespread anecdotal reports, was expected to exert appreciable downward pressure on wage increases over the forecast period. Concurrently, however, the favorable impact of wage disinflation on business costs would be offset in part by increasing costs of healthcare insurance, slower gains in structural productivity associated with reduced business capital investment, and by the necessity to divert some resources to enhance security. The passthrough effects of the substantial decline in energy prices over the past year were a favorable factor in the outlook for core inflation. On balance, core consumer price inflation was projected to remain subdued and quite possibly edge lower.
