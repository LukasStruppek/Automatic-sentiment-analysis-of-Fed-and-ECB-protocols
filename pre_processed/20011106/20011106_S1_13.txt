Core consumer price inflation remained at a relatively subdued pace in August and September; and with energy prices having moderated over the past year, total consumer price inflation had moved down, on a year-over-year basis, to the slower pace of its core component. Both the core consumer price (CPI) index and the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) chain-type index exhibited this general pattern. Core producer price inflation for finished goods also held at a low rate in the August-September period and on a year-over-year basis. With regard to labor costs, total hourly compensation of private industry workers decelerated further in the third quarter, despite a surge in benefit costs, and also slowed noticeably on a year-over-year basis. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers continued to rise in August and September at the relatively moderate rate that had prevailed in earlier months.
