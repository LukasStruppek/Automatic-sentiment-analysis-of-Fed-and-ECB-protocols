All the members indicated that with the risks to the economy clearly tilted toward further weakness, they could vote in favor of retaining a statement to that effect in the press statement to be released shortly after today's meeting. Several stressed that such a statement did not constitute a commitment by the Committee to ease policy further at the next meeting. While the members agreed that significant further weakness in the economy might indeed warrant additional easing, a decision in that regard would depend entirely on the nature of future economic and financial developments.
