The European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada, and the Bank of Japan kept their respective policy rates constant over the intermeeting period. However, overnight interest rates in the euro area declined in the wake of the June 24 injection by the ECB of one-year funds at a fixed rate of 1 percent. The ECB also began its purchases of covered bonds, and yields on intermediate-term European covered bonds declined since the purchases began in early July. After leaving the size of its Asset Purchase Facility (APF) unchanged at its July meeting, the Bank of England, at its August meeting, raised the size of the APF to ÂŁ175 billion and widened the set of gilts it would purchase. Benchmark gilt yields fell noticeably on the announcement after moving higher in July.
