Functioning in short-term funding markets generally showed further improvement over the intermeeting period. Consistent with reduced concerns about the financial condition of large banking institutions, London interbank offered rates (Libor) continued to edge down. Three- and six-month Libor-OIS (overnight index swap) spreads--while still somewhat elevated by historical standards--declined a bit further and stood at levels last recorded in early 2008. Bid-asked spreads for most types of repurchase agreements edged down. Since June, spreads on A2/P2-rated commercial paper and AA-rated asset-backed commercial paper were little changed, on net, remaining at the low ends of their ranges over the past two years. Indicators of Treasury market functioning were little changed over the intermeeting period, and functioning continued to be somewhat impaired. Bid-asked spreads held roughly steady, and trading volumes remained low. The on-the-run liquidity premium for the 10-year Treasury note was little changed at elevated levels, although it was well below its peak last fall.
