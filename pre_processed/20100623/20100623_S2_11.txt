Incoming data suggested that economic activity abroad continued to expand at a strong pace in the first half of the year. Among the advanced foreign economies, growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter was particularly strong in Canada and Japan, and recent indicators for those countries pointed to continued solid increases in the second quarter. In contrast, the rise in economic activity in the euro area was subdued, as favorable readings for the manufacturing sector were counterbalanced by weakness in domestic demand. Since the time of the April meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), concerns about the fiscal situation of several euro-area countries intensified sharply. In response, European authorities announced a number of policy measures, including acceleration of fiscal consolidation plans in some countries, finalization of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Union (EU) assistance package for Greece, and the introduction of a broader â‚¬500 billion financial assistance program that could be complemented by bilateral IMF lending. The European Central Bank (ECB) also announced further measures to improve liquidity conditions in impaired markets, including a program to purchase sovereign and private debt.
