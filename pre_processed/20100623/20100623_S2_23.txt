Yields on the sovereign obligations of peripheral European countries declined noticeably following a May 10 announcement of a framework established by the EU for providing financial aid to euro-area governments and of the ECB's intention to purchase euro-area sovereign debt. However, yields remained high even after these announcements and moved up subsequently, notwithstanding the ECB's purchases of government debt. Amid a weakening outlook for economic growth in Europe, central banks in several emerging European economies began to decrease policy rates. By contrast, brighter economic prospects in Canada and China prompted the Bank of Canada to raise its target for the overnight rate to 50 basis points at its June meeting and Chinese authorities to raise banks' reserve requirement further in May. In addition, the People's Bank of China announced late in the period that it would allow the renminbi to move more flexibly, and the currency appreciated slightly immediately following the announcement.
