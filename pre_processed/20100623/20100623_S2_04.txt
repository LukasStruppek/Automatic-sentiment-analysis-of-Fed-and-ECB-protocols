The rise in consumer spending slowed in recent months after a brisk increase in the first quarter. Although sales of light motor vehicles continued to trend higher, nominal sales of non-auto consumer goods and food services were little changed in April and May. The moderation in spending appeared, on balance, to be aligning the pace of consumption with recent trends in income, wealth, and consumer sentiment. Real disposable personal income moved up at a solid rate in March and April, reflecting increases in employment and hours worked as well as slightly higher real wages, but home values declined in recent months and equity prices moved down since the April meeting. Measures of consumer sentiment improved in May and early June but were still at relatively low levels.
