[' The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would be sustained at a rate a bit above the economys estimated growth potential. The increase in consumer spending was projected to moderate somewhat from its pace in the fourth quarter to a rate generally in line with the expected rise in disposable income. Homebuilding was forecast to decline somewhat but to stabilize at a relatively high level in the context of continued income growth and the generally favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership. Business spending on equipment and structures was projected to expand less rapidly in light of some anticipated slowing in the growth of sales and profits. Fiscal policy and the external sector were expected to exert small restraining influences on economic activity over the year ahead. With resource utilization high and rising, consumer price inflation, as measured by the CPI excluding the relatively volatile food and energy components of the index, was forecast to increase slightly this year in the context of some further pickup in the growth of labor compensation that would include another legislated rise in the federal minimum wage.
