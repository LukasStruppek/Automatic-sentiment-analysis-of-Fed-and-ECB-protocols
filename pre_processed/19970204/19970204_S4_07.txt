[" Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened considerably in the fourth quarter and appeared to have continued at a fairly brisk, though diminished, pace in January. From the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996, M2 is estimated to have grown near the upper end of the Committee's annual range and M3 well above the top of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded moderately on balance over recent months and is estimated to have grown last year near the midpoint of its range. "]
