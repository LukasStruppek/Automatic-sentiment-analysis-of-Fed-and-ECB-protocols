[' Consumer spending registered a sizable increase over the fourth quarter after having grown little during the summer. In December total nominal retail sales rose considerably following a small decline in November. The December increases were spread across all major categories except for some further decline in sales of building materials and supplies. The most recent data on services expenditures pointed to moderate advances in October and November. Surveys indicated that consumer confidence had remained elevated in late 1996 and early 1997. ']
