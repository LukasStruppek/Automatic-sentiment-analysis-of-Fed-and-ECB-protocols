[" At its meeting on December 17, 1996, the Committee issued a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. The directive included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions to reflect a consensus among the members that the risks remained biased toward higher inflation and that the next policy move was more likely to be toward some tightening than toward easing. In this regard, the directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some slowing of the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months. "]
