[' In the Committees discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members favored or could support a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance; the members also strongly supported the retention of a bias toward restraint. An unchanged policy seemed appropriate with inflation still quiescent, with few signs of emerging price pressures, with growth in economic activity seen as likely to moderate appreciably from the unexpectedly strong and unsustainable pace of the fourth quarter, and with considerable uncertainty about future inflationary developments. However, the members emphasized that the extent of the slowdown in economic expansion was unclear and that the persisting, or even greater, tightness of labor markets, coupled with potentially faster growth in worker benefits and diminishing worker insecurity, could put added upward pressure on labor costs and induce some increase in price inflation over time. Even so, most members thought that inflation likely would remain contained for some period ahead and that any strengthening in inflation pressures probably would be gradual, allowing the Committee to respond in a timely manner. Several also commented that a tightening policy action was not generally anticipated in financial markets, and a move at this time could have exaggerated repercussions. A few members emphasized, however, that the recent surge in economic activity had raised the probability that the level of economic output was now above the economys long-run potential, and without a significant slowing in economic growth, inflationary pressures were more likely to increase over the forecast horizon. While an immediate tightening of policy would help to forestall such a buildup of pressures, the members agreed that current uncertainties about the outlook for both the rate of expansion and inflation warranted a continuing "wait and see" policy stance, or at least made such a policy acceptable at this juncture.
