[' Members commented that inflation had remained remarkably subdued, but they expressed considerable concern about the risks of rising inflation in the context of high levels of resource use. They referred in particular to statistical indications, supported by anecdotal reports from around the nation, of very tight conditions in labor markets and some upward pressures on wages. Thus far, the rise in compensation had been held down by diminishing increases in worker benefit costs, and productivity gains also appeared to have had a favorable effect on unit labor costs. In addition, the increases in wages themselves had continued to be restrained by apparent worker concerns about job security. To date, there was no evidence that pressures stemming from tight labor markets had been passed through to a measurable extent to higher prices. ']
