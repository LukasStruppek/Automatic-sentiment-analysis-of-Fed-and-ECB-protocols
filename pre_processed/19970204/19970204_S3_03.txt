[' In their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members observed that the available data and anecdotal information indicated considerable strength in consumer spending in recent months, and they referred to a number of underlying factors that should help to sustain at least moderate further growth in such spending. The latter included the solid expansion in employment and incomes, the increased financial wealth of many consumers, and the high level of consumer confidence as indicated by recent surveys. However, members also cited some factors that would tend to restrain the growth in consumer spending. Among these factors were the effects of the high level of consumer debt and rising repayment problems on both the willingness of households to borrow and of financial intermediaries to lend, the likely absence of pent-up demands after an extended period of expansion, and the possibility of a setback in the stock market. It was difficult to evaluate how these differing factors would on balance affect consumer spending, but the members concluded that the consumer sector was likely to provide important support for sustained economic expansion.
