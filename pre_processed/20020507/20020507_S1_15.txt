In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the major foreign currencies eased somewhat over the intermeeting period. Much of the dollar's decline occurred late in the period in response to the mixed character of U.S. economic data and relatively small declines in benchmark longer-term yields abroad. The dollar rose slightly on average in terms of an index of the currencies of other important trading partners, in part because of the further depreciation of the Argentine peso.
