[' Most interest rates have fallen appreciably since the meeting on August 18, though yields on the bonds of lower-rated firms have increased and a number of large banks have tightened terms and standards for making business loans. Broadly similar developments have occurred in major foreign markets. Share prices in U.S. and global equity markets have remained volatile and major indexes have declined considerably further on balance over the intermeeting period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar declined substantially over the intermeeting period in relation to other major currencies; it was up slightly in terms of an index of the currencies of the developing countries of Latin America and Asia that are important trading partners of the United States.
