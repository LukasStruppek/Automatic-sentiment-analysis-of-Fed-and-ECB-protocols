[" With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, most members expressed a preference for an asymmetric directive tilted toward restraint. These members indicated that near-term developments were not likely to call for an adjustment to policy in either direction. Nonetheless, with the economy expected to be operating in the neighborhood of its potential, the recent rise in inflation and the risk of an unexpected impulse that could ratchet inflation even higher suggested that an asymmetric directive would be more consistent with the Committee's objective of moving over time toward price stability. The economy retained considerable forward momentum and, as had often happened in the past, the recent slowdown in growth could prove to be temporary, with additional monetary tightening needed at some point to contain inflation. In this connection a few members indicated that further tightening might well be needed sooner rather than later. An asymmetric directive also would provide a clear signal of the Committee's intention to resist higher inflation. "]
