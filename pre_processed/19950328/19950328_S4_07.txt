[" On February 1, 1995, the Board of Governors approved an increase from 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent in the discount rate, and in keeping with the Committee's decision at the January 31-February 1 meeting, the increase was allowed to show through fully to interest rates in reserve markets. Nonetheless, most market interest rates have declined somewhat since the Committee meeting; the largest declines have been concentrated in intermediate- and long-term obligations. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was down substantially further over the intermeeting period. The Mexican peso has continued to depreciate against the dollar. "]
