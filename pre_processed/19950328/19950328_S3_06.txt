[' The rapid rise in business inventories in recent quarters had been sustainable in the context of briskly increasing final sales, but with some further accumulation early in the first quarter and economic growth projected to moderate, the rate of inventory investment would have to adjust downward as well. While the timing and extent could not be anticipated with any precision, a short-term inventory correction process might already be under way, with firms initiating cutbacks to production schedules to reflect smaller-than-expected gains in sales over recent months. Members noted that inventory-to-sales ratios already were at generally low levels and they anticipated that any desired adjustments to production would be made quickly. In the circumstances, the size of the inventory correction and its effect on economic activity would be limited. Moreover, reports of inventory shortages in some industries suggested that many firms might raise their desired inventory levels to protect against shortfalls in materials needed in the production process.
