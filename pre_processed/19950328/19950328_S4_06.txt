[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion of economic activity has moderated considerably in early 1995. Nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably further in January and February, but at a pace below the average monthly gain in 1994; the civilian unemployment rate, after rising in January, fell back in February to its December level of 5.4 percent. Advances in industrial production also moderated in January and February, and capacity utilization rates generally changed little from already high levels. Total retail sales were about unchanged over the two months. Housing starts have declined somewhat after posting sizable gains on balance during the closing months of 1994. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a still strong expansion of spending on business equipment, but with tentative signs of some deceleration; nonresidential construction has been trending appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened sharply in January from its average rate in the fourth quarter. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices increased faster on average over January and February. ']
