[" The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth of economic activity was slowing and for some period ahead would average a little less than the rate of increase in the economy's potential output. The pace of the expansion seemed to have slackened somewhat more than had been anticipated at the last meeting; however, the recent declines in long-term interest rates and the rally in stock prices were expected to provide additional support for aggregate demand later in the year. Moreover, the substantial depreciation of the dollar against the yen and several European currencies was acting to offset some of the effects on demand of the previous tightening of reserve conditions. The forecast continued to anticipate that in the period ahead consumer spending would be restrained by smaller gains in real incomes, the substantial degree to which pent-up demands had been satisfied, and the lagged effects of earlier increases in interest rates on the demand for durable goods. Business outlays for new equipment would decelerate substantially in response to slower growth of sales and profits. Homebuilding was projected to decline somewhat further in the near term and to remain at somewhat subdued levels for a time in reflection of the damping effects on housing demand of slower growth in jobs and incomes and of the earlier rise in mortgage rates. Developments in Mexico were likely to interrupt only briefly a strong uptrend in U.S. exports, based on sustained growth in the economies of other U.S. trading partners. Considerable uncertainty continued to surround the federal fiscal outlook but, as in the previous forecast, a moderate pace of deficit reduction was assumed over the forecast horizon. In the staff's judgment, the economy was operating beyond its long-run, noninflationary capacity, and there remained a risk that higher inflation could emerge if the expansion did not moderate sufficiently.
