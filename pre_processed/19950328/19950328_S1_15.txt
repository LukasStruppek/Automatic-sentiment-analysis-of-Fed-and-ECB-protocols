[" In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fell substantially further. The dollar's decline was particularly sharp against the Japanese yen and the German mark, and post-World War II record lows against these two currencies were recorded. Declines in U.S. interest rates and concerns about the persistence of large U.S. trade and fiscal deficits appeared to have contributed to the dollar's drop. Continuing economic and financial problems in Mexico, which resulted in further depreciation on balance of the Mexican peso against the dollar, also seemed to add to negative sentiment toward the dollar because the process of adjustment in the Mexican economy to the lower value of the peso was viewed as implying reduced imports from and increased exports to the United States.
