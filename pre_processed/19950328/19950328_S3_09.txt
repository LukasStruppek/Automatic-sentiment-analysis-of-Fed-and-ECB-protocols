[" Members noted that while the pace of the expansion evidently had slowed, economic activity and utilization of labor and other producer resources were still at very high levels. Prices of many materials inputs to the production process had risen sharply, but thus far there had been only a small pickup in consumer prices. Likewise, the persisting tightness in many labor markets had not to this point fostered appreciable increases in wages. The absence of a significant rise in prices of finished goods or in wages might reflect in some measure the lags in the inflation transmission process, the fruits of heavy business investments in new capacity and more productive equipment in recent years, and perhaps structural changes in business organization that were raising the economy's capacity for sustained, noninflationary activity. Members were concerned, however, that despite continuing competitive pressures and some recent abatement in materials prices, business firms were reporting greater success in passing cost increases through to prices. The depreciation of the dollar also would add to inflationary pressures in the economy. In these circumstances, the members generally concluded that some increase in inflation was likely in coming months. "]
