[" M2 declined, and growth of M3 slowed in February after sizable January gains; data for the first part of March pointed to some recovery in both aggregates. M2's weakness in February partly reflected an unwinding of temporary increases in January of its volatile components, including demand deposits, overnight repurchase agreements, and overnight Eurodollars; the weakness also appeared to be associated with depositor efforts to obtain higher returns by shifting funds into market instruments. The slowdown in growth of M3 in February was entirely attributable to the decline in M2; its non-M2 component increased substantially further as banks continued to rely heavily on managed liabilities to fund loan growth. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt had picked up a little in recent months. "]
