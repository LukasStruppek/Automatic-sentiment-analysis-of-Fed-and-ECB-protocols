[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a strengthening in the expansion of economic activity in the current quarter from the weak second-quarter pace. Nonfarm payroll employment increased in June and July after declining in May; the advance was held down by continuing employment losses in manufacturing. The civilian unemployment rate in July was at its second-quarter average of 5.7 percent. Industrial production changed little in recent months after falling earlier while capacity utilization was down somewhat further. Total retail sales have risen appreciably on balance since early spring, but they edged down in July, reflecting weakness in motor vehicles. Housing starts were up sharply in July after changing little in previous months. Orders for nondefense capital goods still point to considerable further expansion of spending on business equipment over coming months; nonresidential construction has continued to trend appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in the second quarter from its average rate in the first quarter. After increasing at elevated rates in the early part of the year, consumer and producer prices have risen more slowly in recent months. Advances in labor compensation costs have remained subdued. ']
