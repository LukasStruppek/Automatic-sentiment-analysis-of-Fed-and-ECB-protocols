[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in June, with exports declining marginally more than imports. For the second quarter as a whole, the deficit was substantially larger than in the first quarter. Exports were up considerably in the second quarter despite declines in automotive products shipped to Canada and Mexico, but imports rose by even more, with increases widely spread across most major trade categories. In the major foreign industrial countries, economic growth appeared to have ranged from weak to moderate in the second quarter, and the limited available evidence suggested that subdued expansion continued into the third quarter. Economic activity remained particularly weak in Japan. In Europe, expansion apparently was still under way, though somewhat unevenly across countries. ']
