[" At its meeting on July 5-6, 1995, the Committee adopted a directive that called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and that included a tilt toward possible further easing of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint might or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months. "]
