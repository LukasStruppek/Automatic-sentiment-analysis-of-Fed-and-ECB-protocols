[" Members gave particular attention to the ongoing discussions involving the Congress and the Administration regarding future federal budget deficits. There was a great deal of political support for reducing the federal deficit substantially over the years ahead; indeed, in the view of one member the political dynamics might very well result in larger reductions than many now anticipated. Nonetheless, the actual outcome remained particularly uncertain. From the perspective of its macroeconomic stabilization effects and its implications for monetary policy, enactment of legislation involving substantial fiscal restraint would raise the issue of fiscal drag; however, the latter's impact on the economy would have to be judged in the context of attendant adjustments in market interest rates and, more broadly, in the light of emerging economic conditions. A legislative package containing strong fiscal restraint measures would be expected to ease pressures in debt markets--indeed, enhanced prospects in this regard were probably already contributing to reduced long-term interest rates. On the other hand, a package that included only modest deficit reduction might well lead to upward pressure on interest rates. The continuing uncertainty concerning the size of future budget deficits might be complicated by a delay in passing appropriations legislation in the months ahead, with potentially dislocative effects on many federal government operations. Accordingly, federal budget developments were seen as the major factor likely to bear on the performance of the economy over coming months and quarters, and these developments might well differ considerably from current forecasts.
