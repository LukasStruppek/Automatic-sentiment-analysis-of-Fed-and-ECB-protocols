[' Business inventory accumulation slowed markedly further in June, and inventory-to-sales ratios for most types of business establishments declined again. In manufacturing, the aggregate inventory-to-sales ratio was only a little above the historical low reached around the end of 1994. In the wholesale sector, the ratio of stocks to sales in June was slightly below the top of the range prevailing over the last year. At the retail level, inventories changed little in June, and the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector was near the middle of its range for recent years. ']
