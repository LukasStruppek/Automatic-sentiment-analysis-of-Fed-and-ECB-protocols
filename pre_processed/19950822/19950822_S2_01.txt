[" The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth in economic activity would pick up from the weak pace of the second quarter. The inventory adjustment process appeared to be well under way, and moderate expansion of final sales would be supported by the favorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally in the debt and equity markets. In response to improved financial conditions and balance sheets, consumer spending was anticipated to keep pace with the growth of incomes. Homebuilding was expected to strengthen somewhat in response to the earlier decline in mortgage rates and the related improvement in housing affordability. Accompanying slower growth of sales and profits, business investment in new equipment and structures was projected to slow from the very rapid pace of the past few years, although the lower cost of capital and the ready availability of financing would help to sustain appreciable expansion in such investment. Export growth would pick up in response to some expected strengthening in the economies of major trading partners. Considerable uncertainty surrounded the fiscal outlook, but the staff continued to anticipate the greater degree of fiscal restraint that had been projected at the time of the last Committee meeting. In the staff's judgment, the prospects for some further easing of pressure on labor and other resources suggested that price inflation likely would not deviate significantly from recent trends. "]
