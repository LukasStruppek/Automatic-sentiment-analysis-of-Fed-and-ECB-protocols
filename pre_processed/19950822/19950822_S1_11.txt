[' Consumer prices rose more slowly in June and July, with food and energy price movements having little effect on the overall index; price increases for nonfood, non-energy items were somewhat smaller than those seen earlier in the year. Over the twelve-month period ended in July, however, this measure of consumer inflation rose at about the same rate as in the preceding twelve months. Producer prices of finished goods edged lower on balance in June and July, reflecting substantial declines in prices of finished energy goods. Excluding food and energy, producer prices rose by more over the year ended in July than over the preceding year. At earlier stages of production, increases in producer prices had diminished sharply in recent months, perhaps suggesting some abatement of pressures on production capacity and prices. Total hourly compensation for private industry workers increased somewhat more in the second quarter than in the first; however, the rise in compensation costs for the year ended in June was smaller than that for the previous year, primarily reflecting slower growth in costs of benefits. Average hourly earnings grew faster in July than in June; for the year ending in July, earnings rose somewhat more than in the preceding year. ']
