[' In their assessment of the contribution of key sectors of the economy to the expansion, members commented on the current strength of consumer spending and also noted that business contacts were expressing considerable optimism about the prospects for retail sales over the holiday season. Consumer sentiment, as evidenced by survey results and retailer comments, appeared to be at a high level. Some moderation in the growth of consumer spending could be expected to emerge next year for a variety of reasons, including reduced pent-up demands and some anticipated slowing in the growth of employment and consumer incomes. Members also noted that rising interest rates were likely to damp consumer spending, notably for durable goods, though there was little evidence of such a development thus far. A projected softening in housing markets would contribute to slower growth in demand for housing-related consumer durables. ']
