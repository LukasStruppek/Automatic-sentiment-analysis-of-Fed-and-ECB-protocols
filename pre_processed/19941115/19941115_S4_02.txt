[" A majority of the members believed that an unusually sizable firming of monetary policy was desirable at this time, and they endorsed a proposal to tighten reserve conditions in line with a 3/4 percentage point increase in the discount rate that a number of Federal Reserve Banks had proposed for approval by the Board of Governors. In this view, the data becoming available in recent months had suggested considerable resilience and underlying strength in economic activity and rising risks of greater inflation pressures. A somewhat aggressive tightening action would improve the prospects for curbing intensifying inflationary pressures before they gathered further momentum and would help position the economy on a sustainable growth path consistent with the economy's long-run potential. The members acknowledged the difficulty of judging the precise degree of monetary restraint that would be needed to attain the Committee's objectives and in particular the risk that further efforts to control inflation at this juncture might foster greater-than-intended weakening of the expansion. The Committee could not prejudge how much, if any, additional monetary restraint might be needed in the future. That would depend on further developments, but for most members a sizable move at this point represented the most appropriate balance among the competing risks. During this discussion, it was noted that recent developments were having an unsettling effect on financial markets, and a tightening move of this magnitude might contribute to market stability by reducing expectations of higher inflation and a further near-term policy action. Some members also commented that the action would tend to reinforce the recent intervention in the foreign exchange markets. "]
