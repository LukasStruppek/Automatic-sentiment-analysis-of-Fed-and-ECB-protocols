[' Business inventory investment apparently continued at a brisk pace in the third quarter, with much of the accumulation occurring in types of goods where sales were strong. Manufacturing stocks fell in September, but for the third quarter as a whole they increased at the same moderate rate as in the second quarter; the inventory-to-shipments ratio for manufacturing in September remained near the historical low reached the previous month. At the wholesale level, inventory accumulation slowed slightly in the third quarter, and the inventory-to-sales ratio was in the lower end of its range over recent years. Retail inventories surged in August (latest data available) after having declined slightly in July. Nonetheless, the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector remained near the middle of its range in recent years. ']
