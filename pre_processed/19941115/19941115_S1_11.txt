[' Consumer price inflation remained moderate in September. For items other than the food and energy components, the increase in consumer prices over the twelve months ending in September was slightly smaller than the rise over the previous twelve months. At the producer level, prices of finished goods declined, largely reflecting a sharp fall in prices of finished energy goods. Excluding food and energy items, producer prices edged up in September and had risen slowly over the twelve months ending in September. At intermediate stages of processing, prices of many materials, notably industrial materials, had continued to move up rapidly. Total compensation of private industry workers rose significantly less over the four quarters ending in September than over the previous four quarters, primarily reflecting a sharply smaller increase in benefit costs. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers recorded a large gain in September after having expanded moderately over previous months. ']
