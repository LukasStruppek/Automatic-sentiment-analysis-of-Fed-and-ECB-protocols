[" The evidence of persisting growth in aggregate demand at a pace appreciably above that of the economy's long-run potential and of developing pressures on resources tended to be confirmed by anecdotal reports of robust business expansion in many parts of the country and growing difficulties in hiring and retaining some types of labor. Ongoing cutbacks in some industries, such as defense, were tending to hold down overall economic activity in a few regions, but all parts of the country appeared to be experiencing at least modest economic growth, including California where economic activity now seemed to have turned up after an extended period of weakness. Sentiment among retailers and other business contacts was widely reported to be quite favorable. In addition, some members commented that despite higher interest rates financial conditions generally remained conducive to further business expansion. The lending constraints that had tended to retard the expansion earlier seemed to have given way to increasingly accommodative loan policies by depository institutions and ready access to market sources of financing for many business firms.
