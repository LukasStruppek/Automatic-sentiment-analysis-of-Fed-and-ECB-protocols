[" In the Committee's discussion of the outlook for prices, the members saw considerable potential for higher inflation if growth in demand and output continued at an unsustainable pace, placing added pressures on labor and other producer resources. They noted indications of greater inflation pressures, especially in the rising prices of many materials used in the production process and the increasing number of reports of labor shortages. To date, prices of finished goods and services did not reflect those pressures and overall wage inflation did not appear to be trending higher. Even so, at least some modest worsening of inflation seemed quite likely over the quarters immediately ahead, despite the persistence of strong competition that continued to limit attempts to raise prices in most markets. This view seemed to be reinforced by increasing reports of successful efforts by some business firms to establish and sustain higher prices and by numerous indications of business plans to raise prices around year-end or the early part of next year. Other factors that appeared to have adverse implications for the inflation outlook included faster increases in import prices, and in the view of at least some members the prospect of diminishing gains in productivity. Moreover, as evidenced by the comments of some business contacts and the behavior of financial markets, inflationary expectations might be in the process of worsening, though such a development could not be seen in broad survey results. To what extent such expectations would become more pervasive and foster greater inflation momentum was very difficult to gauge at this point. One member suggested that some further rise in inflation might reflect a typical development in a maturing cyclical expansion but that such a rise would not necessarily augur a permanent uptick in inflation or even that progress toward price stability would not continue to be made over time, provided appropriate monetary policies were pursued.
