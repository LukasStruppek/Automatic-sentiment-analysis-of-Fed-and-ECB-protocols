[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the growth of the economy has remained substantial. Nonfarm payroll employment advanced appreciably further in October, and the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 5.8 percent. Industrial production registered a large increase in October after posting sizable gains on average over other recent months, and capacity utilization moved up further from already high levels. Retail sales have continued to rise rapidly. Housing starts rose appreciably in September. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong expansion in spending on business equipment; permits for nonresidential construction have been trending higher. Inventory accumulation appears to have continued at a brisk pace in the third quarter. For July and August combined, the nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened from its second-quarter average. Prices of many materials have continued to move up rapidly, but broad indexes of prices for consumer goods and services have increased moderately on average over recent months. ']
