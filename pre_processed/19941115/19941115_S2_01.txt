[" The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth in economic activity would slow markedly over the next several quarters and for a period would average less than the rate of increase in the economy's potential output. In the staff's judgment, the economy currently was operating at or beyond its long-run capacity, and the forecast assumed that monetary policy would not accommodate any continuing tendency for aggregate demand to expand at a pace that could foster sustained higher inflation. The expansion of consumer spending was projected to slow considerably in response to diminishing pent-up demands, higher borrowing costs, and reduced income growth. Business fixed investment also was anticipated to decelerate appreciably in the context of smaller increases in sales and less favorable financial conditions. Homebuilding was expected to be damped by higher financing costs, although housing activity likely would remain well above the depressed levels of recent years when cash-flow affordability had been less favorable. The lower value of the dollar and the favorable prospects for faster economic recovery abroad were projected to bolster the demand for U.S. exports. With the economy having reached or exceeded its long-run potential in the staff's judgment, wage and price inflation was projected to pick up for a period before turning down as pressures on productive resources eased.
