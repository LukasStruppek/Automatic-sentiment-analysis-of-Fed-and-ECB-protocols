[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members agreed that the current stance of monetary policy presented unacceptable risks of embedding higher inflation in the economy. The expansion retained appreciably more forward momentum and greater inflationary potential than the members had anticipated, given the policy restraint implemented earlier this year. The reasons for that outcome remained unclear. Among the suggested explanations were that the earlier restraint appeared to have had a less-than-expected effect on current economic conditions and, in particular, on the more interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. Some members also suggested that the underlying expansion was stronger than they had anticipated, and a couple referred to the possibility that the lingering effects from the accommodative policy stance maintained through last year were larger than had been expected. Moreover, additional monetary restraint seemed to be needed to counteract the stimulative effects on domestic economic activity of a number of atypical financial developments in a period of rising interest rates; these included the easing of non-price credit terms by depository institutions, the ample availability of funds in debt and equity markets, and the depreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The members recognized that monetary policy actions exerted much of their effects after relatively long lags and that a substantial portion of the restraint stemming from the earlier policy actions undoubtedly had not yet been felt in the economy. They agreed, nonetheless, that monetary policy was still insufficiently restrictive in light of emerging inflationary signals in the economy. Views differed to some extent, however, regarding the degree of additional restraint that might be needed to foster the Committee's objectives for sustainable, noninflationary economic growth. "]
