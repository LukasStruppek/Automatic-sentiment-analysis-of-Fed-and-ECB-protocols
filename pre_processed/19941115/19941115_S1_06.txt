[' Industrial production increased substantially in October after having posted appreciable advances on balance in previous months. Manufacturing output accounted for all of the October rise as production declined again in the mining and utilities components. In manufacturing, the pace of motor vehicle assemblies was unchanged, but production in automotive-related industries was stepped up noticeably and output of business equipment continued to expand vigorously. Total utilization of industrial capacity climbed further in October from already elevated rates. ']
