[' After a surge in the second quarter, inventory investment remained substantial in the third quarter and appeared to be continuing at a robust pace in the current quarter. For a variety of reasons, inventory accumulation might well be relatively brisk for some period of time, given the favorable sales experience of numerous business firms and the still quite low levels of inventories relative to sales. Moreover, with capacity pressures in many industries leading to some lengthening in delivery times, businesses would tend to build inventories to support sales and avoid disruptions to production schedules. Tending to confirm such an assessment were anecdotal reports suggesting that recent additions to inventories were largely intended and not the result of disappointing sales. An inventory buildup at the pace recorded on average in the second and third quarters would not be sustainable, but inventory investment was likely to be relatively well maintained over coming months if aggregate demand were to expand in line with current expectations.
