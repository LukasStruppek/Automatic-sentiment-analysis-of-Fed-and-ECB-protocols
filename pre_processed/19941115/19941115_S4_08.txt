[" In the course of their review, the members discussed sterilized intervention by the Federal Reserve in the foreign exchange markets. They generally agreed that in certain circumstances such intervention serves a useful purpose, such as helping to counter disorderly market conditions, but it normally would not be expected to have lasting effects on the foreign exchange value of the dollar in the absence of other policy adjustments. In the overwhelming number of instances for more than a decade, the Federal Reserve has participated jointly with the U.S. Treasury in foreign exchange operations. In the view of most members it seemed advisable to continue that procedure, especially given the System's responsibilities for the overall financial health of the economy and ongoing cooperation with the Treasury regarding the nation's broad financial objectives. Nonetheless, the apparently limited and temporary effectiveness of sterilized intervention counseled caution in reliance on such transactions. Against this background, nearly all the members believed that the System's reciprocal currency arrangements, which were a potential source of foreign currencies that might be used for intervention purposes as well as an ongoing symbol of cooperation with other participating central banks, should be renewed for another year.
