[" M2 continued to edge lower in October; the weakness was concentrated in its more-liquid deposit components, for which opportunity costs had risen very substantially this year. M3 expanded at a moderate pace, buoyed by continued rapid growth in large-denomination time deposits issued to finance rapid loan growth and to counter runoffs of nondeposit sources of funds. For the year through October, M2 grew at a rate at the bottom of the Committee's range for 1994 and M3 at a rate in the lower half of its range for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months. "]
