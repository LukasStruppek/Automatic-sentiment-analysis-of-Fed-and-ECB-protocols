All the members indicated that they could accept a proposal to move the balance of risks statement from potential weakness to a neutral position. It was clear that significant downside risks remained in the economy even apart from any major unanticipated shocks to business and consumer confidence, but in light of the strength of the recent economic information nearly all the members agreed that a balanced risks statement now best represented their consensus regarding the economic outlook over the foreseeable future. Members noted that a neutral statement did not preclude a tightening policy move should the latter seem warranted by rapidly evolving economic conditions.
