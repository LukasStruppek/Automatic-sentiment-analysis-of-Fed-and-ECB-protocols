The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding briskly in the early months of the year after having turned up and increased modestly in the fourth quarter. Elevated household spending and a shift from inventory liquidation to accumulation would provide significant impetus for the recovery in the context of the substantial monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place. Moreover, the recently enacted federal incentive for new business equipment investment along with the outlook for continued robust gains in productivity were expected to help boost business capital spending. At the same time, still-depressed equity prices, limited growth abroad, and the dollar's strength would tend to hold down the pace of recovery. On balance, recent developments suggested that the course of final sales now had a more positive contour over the forecast horizon and that resource utilization would rise somewhat more than anticipated earlier despite higher projected growth in structural productivity. Even so, overall activity would remain below estimates of the economy's potential output for some time, and the persistence of underutilized resources was expected to keep downward pressure on core price inflation.
