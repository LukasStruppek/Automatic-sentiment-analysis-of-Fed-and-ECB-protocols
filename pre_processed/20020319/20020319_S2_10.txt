Consumer price inflation picked up a bit in January as energy prices posted their first increase since September. However, on a year-over-year basis, core price inflation as measured by the consumer price index leveled out at a moderate rate, while core PCE (personal consumption expenditure) price inflation declined appreciably. Labor costs also appeared to have decelerated recently. The employment cost index for hourly compensation in private industry rose moderately in the fourth quarter of last year and for the year as a whole. Both the salary and benefits components recorded slightly smaller increases last year. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers advanced only slightly in January and February of this year, and the average wage increase during the twelve months through February was slightly lower than that for the twelve-month period ending in February 2001.
