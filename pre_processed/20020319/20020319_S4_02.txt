Looking ahead, however, the stance of policy would need to be adjusted at some point to provide less stimulus as the members gained more confidence that the recovery was becoming better entrenched and the risks had shifted toward rising inflationary pressures. The need to adjust monetary policy during the early stages of a recovery presented a special challenge with regard to its timing and extent in that raising rates prematurely or too precipitately could weaken or abort the recovery, while waiting too long could risk a pickup in inflationary pressures later. Members concluded that the Committee would be in a better position to assess the appropriate timing of a policy change at the May meeting when it would have more information to gauge the economy's performance in two critical areas, namely developments relating to inventory investment and the implications of trends in sales and profits for capital investment. A reference to the Committee's currently accommodative policy stance in the press announcement to be issued shortly after this meeting would alert the public to the need to firm policy at some point in the future.
