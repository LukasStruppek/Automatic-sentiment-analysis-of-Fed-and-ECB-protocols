In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the major foreign currencies eased slightly on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar fell more against the yen than the euro despite negative economic news from Japan and the disappointing reaction to the Japanese government's announcement of an "anti-deflation" package. The exchange value of the dollar changed little in terms of an index of the currencies of other important trading partners, in part because of the further depreciation of the Argentine peso.
