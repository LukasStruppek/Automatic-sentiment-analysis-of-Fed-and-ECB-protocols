In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the decidedly positive information received over the intermeeting period provided strong evidence that an economic recovery was now under way, though its prospective strength remained subject to substantial uncertainty. In this regard it was noted that the economy was undergoing significant structural changes and those changes were adding to the usual difficulty of projecting the trajectory of economic activity after a turning point. Unexpected strength in household expenditures, much reduced weakness in business capital spending, and substantial slowing in inventory liquidation had produced an earlier upturn in economic activity than many had anticipated. A further strengthening of inventory investment would probably generate appreciable further growth in business activity over the quarters just ahead. Once the ongoing inventory correction was completed, however, it was not clear to what extent final demand in key sectors of the economy, notably business capital investment, would provide support for further economic growth. While the members agreed that the stimulative fiscal and monetary policies currently in place would undergird further economic expansion, most continued to anticipate a relatively subdued rate of expansion that would only gradually erode current margins of underutilized productive resources. The members viewed the outlook for core price inflation as still quite benign, largely reflecting the ample availability of labor and other producer resources to accommodate rising economic activity and the favorable prospects for further robust growth in productivity.
