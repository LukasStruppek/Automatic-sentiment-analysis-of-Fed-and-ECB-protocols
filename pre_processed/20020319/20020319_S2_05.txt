Consumer spending remained strong in the early part of the year, despite a sizable drop in purchases of light vehicles in January that was followed by a rebound in February as manufacturers switched from attractive financing terms to cash rebates. Outlays for retail items other than motor vehicles expanded further in February after the large increases recorded in the two prior months. Outlays for services continued to rise moderately in January (latest data). Consumer purchases were supported by a sizable gain in disposable personal income in January, and readings on consumer sentiment were close to their historical averages.
