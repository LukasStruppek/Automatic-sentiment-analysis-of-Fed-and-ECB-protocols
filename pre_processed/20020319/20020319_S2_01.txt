At this meeting the staff requested Committee guidance on the priorities, given limited staff resources, it should attach to further studies of the feasibility of outright purchases for the System Open Market Account (SOMA) of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA-MBS) and the addition of foreign sovereign debt securities to the list of collateral eligible for U.S. dollar repurchase agreements by the System. Such alternatives could prove useful if outstanding Treasury debt obligations were to become increasingly scarce relative to the necessary growth in the System's portfolio, and the Committee had previously requested initial staff exploration of these options. Noting that many of the staff engaged in these studies were also involved in contingency planning, which had been intensified after the September 11 attacks, the consensus of the members was to give the highest priority to such planning. All the members preferred continued reliance to the extent feasible on direct Treasury debt for outright System transactions, and they were persuaded that budget developments over the last year meant that constraints on Treasury debt supplies would not become as pressing an issue as soon as they had previously thought. Still, given the inherent uncertainty of budget forecasts, the likely significant needs for large SOMA operations in coming years and the lead times needed to implement new procedures, the Committee decided that the study of alternative market instruments should go forward once it was possible to do so without impeding the contingency planning effort. With regard to the two proposed alternatives for broadening the System's options for open market operations, the members instructed the staff to give a higher priority to further examination of outright purchases of GNMA-MBS. Although these securities have a number of shortcomings as an outright investment vehicle from the System's perspective, the market for GNMA-MBS was well developed and the securities were guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.
