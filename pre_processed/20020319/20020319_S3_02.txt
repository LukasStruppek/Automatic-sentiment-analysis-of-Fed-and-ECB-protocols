The federal funds rate remained close to the Committee's target level of 1-3/4 percent during the intermeeting period. However, short-term market rates increased slightly over the intermeeting interval, and yields on longer-term Treasury instruments and high-grade corporate bonds rose by more. The rise in rates was sparked initially by market participants' reading of the Committee's press statement as suggesting greater-than-expected optimism about the economy going forward. That assessment was subsequently strengthened by data on spending and output released during the intermeeting interval that came in well above market expectations. Speculative-grade bond yields fell somewhat in reaction to the improved economic outlook and the perceived reduction of credit risk. Most major indexes of equity prices moved up sharply on the bullish economic reports.
