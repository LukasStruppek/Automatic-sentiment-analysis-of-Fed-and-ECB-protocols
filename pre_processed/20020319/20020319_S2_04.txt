Industrial production increased somewhat in January and February after a steep decline from its June 2000 peak. Manufacturing output rose in both months, and the factory operating rate moved up slightly from its low level at year-end. The pickup in manufacturing this year was spread across several major industries, including chemicals, computers and semiconductors, paper, and tobacco. In addition, output of communications equipment steadied after having plunged for more than a year. In contrast, production of motor vehicles and parts changed little over January and February after a surge late in 2001.
