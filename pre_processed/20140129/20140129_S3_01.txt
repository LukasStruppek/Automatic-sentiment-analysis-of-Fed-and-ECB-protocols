 In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, participants generally noted that economic activity had strengthened more in the second half of 2013 than they had expected at the time of the December meeting In particular, consumer spending had strengthened, and business investment appeared to be on a more solid uptrend Although the government shutdown likely damped economic growth somewhat, the extent of restraint on growth from fiscal policy diminished late in the year However, several participants observed that temporary factors had helped boost real GDP during the second half, pointing specifically to the substantial contributions from net exports and increased inventory investment As a result, participants generally did not expect the recent pace of economic growth to be sustained, but they nonetheless anticipated that the economy would expand at a moderate pace in coming quarters That expansion was expected to be supported by highly accommodative monetary policy, a further easing of fiscal restraint, and a modest additional pickup in global economic growth, as well as continued improvement in credit conditions and the ongoing strengthening in household balance sheets A number of participants noted that recent economic news had reinforced their confidence in their projection of moderate economic growth over the medium run It was also noted that recent developments in several emerging market economies, if they continued, could pose downside risks to the outlook Overall, most participants still viewed the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having become more nearly balanced in recent months
