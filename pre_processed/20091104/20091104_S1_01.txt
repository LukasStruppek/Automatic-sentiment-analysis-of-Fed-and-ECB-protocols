 The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in domestic and foreign financial markets The Manager also reported on System open market operations in Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) since the Committee's September 22-23 meeting By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified those transactions There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period Since the Committee met in September, the Federal Reserve's total assets were about unchanged, on balance, at approximately $22 trillion, as the increase in the System's holdings of securities roughly matched a further decline in usage of the System's credit and liquidity facilities The Manager noted that, as of October 30, $300 billion in Treasury securities had been purchased, as directed by the Committee Overall, the Treasury market had recovered substantially from the strains during the financial crisis, and the Manager reported that the completion of the Federal Reserve's purchase program did not appear to have led to any significant upward pressure on Treasury yields or to any notable deterioration in Treasury market functioning There was little evidence, to date, of a buildup in year-end funding pressures, although demand for Treasury bills with maturities extending just beyond the year-end seemed to be elevated The Manager noted that the recent path of purchases of agency debt was consistent with buying a cumulative amount of $175 billion by the end of the first quarter of 2010
