[' Business fixed investment appeared to have rebounded from a small decrease in the third quarter that had been associated in part with a strike-related drop in business purchases of motor vehicles and persisting weakness in nonresidential construction. Shipments of office and computing equipment rose sharply in October after having declined for two months, and a sizable backlog of orders for communications equipment suggested that the downturn in shipments in October after a September surge would be shortlived. In addition, outlays for heavy trucks reached record levels and expenditures for aircraft were well maintained. In the nonresidential sector, building activity remained soft in October. Office construction picked up further in response to falling vacancy rates and rising rental costs, but other building activity continued sluggish, and available data on new contracts pointed to persisting weakness.
