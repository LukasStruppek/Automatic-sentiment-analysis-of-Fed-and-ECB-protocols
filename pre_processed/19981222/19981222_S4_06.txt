[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the economy has continued to expand at a brisk pace in recent months. Growth in nonfarm payroll employment was strong in November, after more moderate gains in September and October, and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent. Total industrial production declined somewhat in November, but manufacturing output was stable and up considerably from the third-quarter pace. Business inventory accumulation slowed appreciably in October after a sizable rise in the third quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed slightly in October from its third-quarter average. Total retail sales rose sharply in October and November, and housing starts were strong as well. Available indicators point to a considerable pickup in business capital spending after a lull in the third quarter. Trends in various measures of wages and prices have been mixed in recent months. ']
