[' Consumer price inflation remained subdued in November, with both the overall index and the index excluding food and energy items rising at the same relatively low rates as in October. For the twelve months ended in November, the increase in core consumer prices was a little higher than in the previous twelve-month period, reflecting slightly bigger advances in the prices of both commodities and services. A similar pattern was evident in producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy; core producer prices continued to rise at a low rate in November, and the increase in these prices in the twelve months ended in November was somewhat larger than in the previous twelve-month period. In contrast, prices for crude and intermediate materials continued their downward trend in both the October-November period and the twelve months ended in November. Growth in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers had slowed over recent months to a modest rate in October and November. While the deceleration in hourly earnings was relatively widespread across industries, and most pronounced in manufacturing, wages continued to accelerate in the services industries and in finance, insurance, and real estate.
