[" M2 and M3 had continued to expand rapidly in recent months, although incoming data indicated that growth was slowing somewhat in December. The continued strength of M2 in November reflected the reduction in its opportunity cost as a result of recent easings of monetary policy, greater growth of liquid deposits in association with heavy mortgage refinancing activity, and brisk demand for U.S. currency both at home and abroad. M3 growth was bolstered by further large flows into institution-only money market funds and additional RP financing in association with hefty acquisitions of securities by banks. For the year through November, both aggregates rose at rates well above the Committee's annual ranges. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had expanded in recent months at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range. Continued paydowns of debt by the federal government were more than offset by appreciable growth of private demands for credit to finance strong spending on durable goods, housing, and business investment, as well as merger and acquisition activity.
