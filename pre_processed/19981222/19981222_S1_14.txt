[' At its meeting on November 17, 1998, the Committee adopted a directive that called for implementing conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with a one-quarter percentage point decrease in the federal funds rate to an average of around 4-3/4 percent. The Committee also decided that moving to a symmetric directive would be appropriate, given that further easing likely would not be needed over the months ahead unless unexpected developments were to point toward a more substantial weakening in the growth of economic activity or to less inflation than was currently anticipated. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over the months ahead. ']
