[" In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar fell slightly over the intermeeting period in relation to other major currencies and also in terms of an index of the currencies of other countries that are important trading partners of the United States. Concerns about the vulnerability of U.S. markets to financial difficulties in Brazil and uncertainty generated by the impeachment proceedings were said to weigh on the dollar at times. The dollar's larger decline against the Japanese yen than against the German mark and other European currencies may have stemmed from a disparity in interest rate movements in those countries; long-term interest rates rose in Japan, partly in anticipation of heightened financing requirements associated with further fiscal stimulus, while European interest rates fell in response to cuts in official interest rates and weaker-than-expected economic data. Financial conditions affecting emerging market economies continued to improve for a time after the Committee eased monetary policy at its November 17 meeting, but that trend was subsequently reversed after Brazil's legislature decided to reject a key fiscal reform measure.
