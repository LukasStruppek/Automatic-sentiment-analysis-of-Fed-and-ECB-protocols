[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity advanced considerably further in the second quarter, but increases in final demand showed some signs of moderation. Nonfarm payroll employment was up substantially in April and May; the civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent in May. Industrial production increased appreciably further in May, reflecting gains across a wide range of industries. Real consumer spending rose substantially on balance over April and May. Single-family housing starts fell considerably in May from a relatively high level in April. Orders and contracts point to some deceleration in spending on business equipment and nonresidential structures after a very rapid expansion earlier in the year. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in April from its rate in the first quarter. Upward pressures on food and energy prices have led to somewhat larger increases in the consumer price index over recent months. ']
