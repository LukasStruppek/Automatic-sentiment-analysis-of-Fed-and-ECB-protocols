[' Growth in business expenditures on durable equipment and nonresidential structures appeared to be slowing following a surge in outlays in the first quarter. In May, shipments of nondefense capital goods rebounded from the substantial decline in April; however, excluding movements in the volatile aircraft category, shipments were down on balance over the two months. Among the major components, shipments of both computing and communications equipment fell sharply in April and retraced only part of that decline in May. Recent data on new orders pointed to more modest increases in spending on business equipment over the months ahead. Nonresidential building activity increased considerably further in April (latest data available), but incoming information on contracts suggested that growth in nonresidential construction would weaken somewhat in coming months.
