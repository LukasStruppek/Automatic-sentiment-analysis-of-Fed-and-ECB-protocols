[' Total nominal retail sales surged in May after having changed little in April; the increase in sales, coupled with available information on prices, suggested that real consumer spending on goods had risen substantially on balance since the first quarter. Recent data (available through April) indicated that spending on services had increased moderately on balance in recent months. Single-family housing starts fell considerably in May from the relatively high April level. The decline suggested that the rise in mortgage rates in recent months had begun to damp construction activity, but indicators of housing demand, such as sales of new and existing homes, remained relatively robust.
