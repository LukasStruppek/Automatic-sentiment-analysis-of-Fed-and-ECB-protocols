[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all but one of the members supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. These members also indicated that they preferred or could accept an asymmetric directive that was biased toward restraint. In their view, the most likely outcome was a slowing of the expansion to a more sustainable pace and a continuation of subdued inflation. Nevertheless, they were concerned that the risks to that outcome were tilted toward higher inflation, While a strong economy generally was a welcome development, at current levels of resource use a continuation of rapid growth was not likely to be sustainable because it would have the potential for adding significantly to inflation pressures. However, inflation had remained relatively damped thus far and the rise in interest rates among other factors was expected to curb demand. Moreover, any tendency for price pressures to mount was likely to emerge only gradually and be reversible through a relatively limited policy adjustment. The current stance of monetary policy could not be described in this view as clearly accommodative. While the federal funds rate had been reduced appreciably in nominal terms over the past year, its current level on an inflation-adjusted basis seemed to be only marginally below its peak prior to mid-1995. In the circumstances, the Committee could afford to wait for more evidence to see whether additional inflation pressures were likely to develop. A number of key economic data would become available over the next several weeks that would provide a much better basis for assessing the economy's momentum over the second half of the year and the outlook for inflation.
