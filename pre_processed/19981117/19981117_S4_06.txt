[" The information reviewed at this meeting suggests some moderation in the expansion of economic activity from a brisk pace during the summer months. Growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed appreciably in September and October; the civilian unemployment rate remained near 4-1/2 percent. Industrial production has declined slightly in recent months. Business inventory accumulation was sizable in the third quarter, and stock- sales ratios rose to uncomfortable levels in some sectors strongly affected by the nation's trade deficit. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened somewhat in July-August from its second-quarter average. Total retail sales rose sharply in October after increasing only moderately in August and September. Residential sales and building starts have remained quite strong, but below recent peaks. Available indicators point to a pickup in business capital spending after a lull in the third quarter, owing in part to a recovery from the summer strike in the motor vehicle industry. Trends in various measures of wages and prices have been mixed in recent months. "]
