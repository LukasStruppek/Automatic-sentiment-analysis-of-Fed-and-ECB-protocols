[' Available indicators pointed to a pickup in business capital spending after a third quarter lull, owing to some extent to a recovery from the General Motors strike. Business investment expenditures during the summer were held down in part by the strike- related decline in fleet sales of new motor vehicles. In addition, spending for other types of business equipment grew somewhat more slowly in the third quarter after having expanded at an extraordinary pace earlier in the year. Orders received by U.S. equipment makers continued to trend up through September. In contrast, nonresidential building activity apparently fell somewhat further in the third quarter. While the construction of lodging facilities surged and the construction of office space persisted at a high level, there was a decline in other commercial building, which includes retail stores and warehouses, industrial structures, and institutional buildings. The availability of financing for various types of construction appeared to lessen substantially in late summer, and financing costs rose for many borrowers. ']
