[' The rapid buildup in inventories during the third quarter was not likely to continue, but the timing and extent of the expected moderation were largely unpredictable. It was noted in this regard that while inventories appeared to have risen to uncomfortable levels in some industries, there was no evidence of a general inventory overhang.

It was unclear at this point to what extent year 2000 concerns might stimulate extra inventory investment prior to the end of 1999. ']
