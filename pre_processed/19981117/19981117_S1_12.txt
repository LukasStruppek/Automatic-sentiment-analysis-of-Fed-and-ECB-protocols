[" Business inventory accumulation was sizable in the third quarter, and stocks-sales ratios rose to uncomfortable levels in some industries that were being adversely affected by the nation's growing trade deficit. In manufacturing, however, stockbuilding slowed during the summer months and the stock-shipment ratio was unchanged at a level just above its average for the past year. At the wholesale level, a rapid increase during the third quarter lifted the inventory- sales ratio for this sector to its highest level since 1986; nearly half the rise was the result of a buildup of farm products that was related in part to an early harvest, but wholesalers of machinery, chemicals, and metals and minerals also apparently experienced undesired buildups of stocks. Retail inventories excluding motor vehicles accumulated at a slow pace during the summer, and the inventory-sales ratio for this category remained well within the narrow range of the past year. "]
