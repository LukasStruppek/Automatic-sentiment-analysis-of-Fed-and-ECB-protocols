[' In their review of recent and prospective developments across the nation and in key sectors of the economy, members referred to scattered indications of some slowing in private domestic final demands. In the important consumer sector, however, evidence of weakening growth in expenditures was quite limited. The most recent anecdotal reports pointed to solid growth in most though not all regions of the country, and retail sales posted a strong advance in October. Moreover, consumer sentiment remained at a high level, albeit below its peak earlier in the year according to a recent survey. Members commented, however, that the more moderate growth in employment and incomes experienced recently likely would persist and should result in reduced gains in consumer expenditures next year, but they also noted that the extent of the deceleration was subject to considerable uncertainty. Some members referred to reports from contacts in the retailing industry who expressed some concern about the potential for weaker retail sales after the holiday season. A significant factor bearing on consumer spending would be the performance of the stock market. The impetus from the wealth effects of rapidly rising share prices would wane if such prices were to stabilize near current levels. ']
