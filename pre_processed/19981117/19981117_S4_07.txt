[' The Committee voted unanimously to re-authorize Federal Reserve participation in the North American Framework Agreement, established in 1994, and the associated bilateral reciprocal currency ("swap") arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico. These arrangements, which predated the North American Framework Agreement, were linked into a trilateral facility in connection with the establishment of the North American Financial Group in 1994 to facilitate consultation and cooperation among the three countries in the area of macroeconomic policy as an outgrowth of the increasing integration of those economies expected to result from the North American Free Trade Agreement.
