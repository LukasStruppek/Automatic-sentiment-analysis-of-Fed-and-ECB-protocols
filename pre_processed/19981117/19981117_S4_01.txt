[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, nearly all the members indicated that they could accept a proposal to reduce the federal funds rate by a further 25 basis points to an average of 4-3/4 percent. This policy decision was viewed as a close call by several members. While the growth of the economy was expected to slow appreciably over the year ahead, the expansion currently displayed only modest signs of moderating from what seemed to be an unsustainable pace. Moreover, many members saw some risk that an easing move at this point might trigger a strong further advance in stock market prices that would not be justified on the basis of likely future earnings and could therefore lead to a relatively sharp and disruptive market adjustment later. The members were more concerned, however, about the risks stemming from the still sensitive state of financial markets, and in that regard many believed that a prompt policy easing would help to ensure against a resurgence of severe financial strains. A further easing move would complete the policy adjustment to the changed economic and financial climate that had emerged since midsummer and would provide some insurance against any unexpectedly severe weakening of the expansion. Most members saw little risk that a modest easing would ignite inflationary pressures in the economy, given the subdued behavior of inflation and their outlook for economic activity. Moreover, the easing could readily be reversed if unexpected circumstances should call for such an action. In this view, the risks of inaction were greater in terms of the potential financial consequences and also could materialize much sooner than the risks of stimulating greater inflation through the slight easing that was contemplated.
