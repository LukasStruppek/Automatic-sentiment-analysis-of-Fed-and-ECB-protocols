[' Personal consumption expenditures rose considerably further during the third quarter, though at a much slower pace than that recorded earlier in the year. Retail sales were down slightly on balance during the quarter, reflecting a sharp drop in sales of motor vehicles associated with the work stoppage at General Motors. However, the settlement of that strike and the resumption of production led to an upturn in overall motor vehicle sales in August and a sizable advance in September. A large further gain in such sales contributed to a sharp rise in overall retail sales in October. Consumer confidence retreated further in October, but according to a major survey it turned up in early November, albeit to a level still somewhat below its peak earlier in the year. ']
