At its May meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to raise its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 5 percent. The Committee's accompanying statement indicated that economic growth had been quite strong so far this year. The Committee saw growth as likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices. At that time, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appeared to have had only a modest effect on core inflation. Ongoing productivity gains had helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remained contained. Still, possible increases in resource utilization and the elevated prices of energy and other commodities had the potential to add to inflation pressures. In these circumstances, the Committee foresaw the possibility of a need for some further policy firming to address inflation risks but emphasized that the extent and timing of any such firming would depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.
