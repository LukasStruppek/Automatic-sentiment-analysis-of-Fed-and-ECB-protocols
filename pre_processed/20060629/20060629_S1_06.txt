Residential construction activity moderated over the past few months but remained at a historically high level. Single-family starts posted a sizable drop in May for the third consecutive month. Although a substantial portion of May's decline seemed to be a partial payback for the elevated level of starts early in the year, when weather conditions had been favorable, the underlying pace of single-family housing construction appeared to have slowed. In the multifamily sector, starts in May were well within the typical range seen since 1995. Sales of both new and existing single-family homes in April and May were significantly below their peaks of the summer of 2005, though new home sales continued to regain some ground after having fallen in February. The most reliable measures of house prices indicated modest growth following the rapid increases seen last year.
