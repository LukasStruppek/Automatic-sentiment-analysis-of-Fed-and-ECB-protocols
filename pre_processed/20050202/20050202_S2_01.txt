In the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, the economy was seen as likely to expand at a pace a little above that of its longer-run potential over this year and next, while hiring was expected to firm some more, resulting in a further decrease in the unemployment rate. Household spending was projected to grow at a fairly solid rate, supported by higher employment and somewhat lower energy prices but damped somewhat by lessened stimulus from gains in wealth and the need for households to rebuild savings. After a temporary dip in the level of business investment this quarter related to the expiration of the partial-expensing tax provision, investment outlays were seen as likely to resume vigorous growth in response to steadily rising sales, strong corporate balance sheets, supportive financial conditions, and an ongoing need to replace or upgrade aging equipment and software. Real net exports were projected to be roughly stable for several quarters, held up by the lagged effect of the lower foreign exchange value of the dollar and some strengthening in foreign demand. Measures of total consumer price inflation were expected to decline over the forecast horizon as energy prices receded, while core inflation was seen as remaining stable in the staff forecast. Tendencies for core inflation to increase because of slightly higher trend unit labor costs and a narrowing margin of resource slack were expected to be offset by the waning contribution of elevated prices for energy and imported goods.
