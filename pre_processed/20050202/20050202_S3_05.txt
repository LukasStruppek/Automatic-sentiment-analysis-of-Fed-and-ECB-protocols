Several participants mentioned that the low level of measured national saving, which implied a continued need for foreign financing of U.S. investment, and imbalances in the external sector imparted additional uncertainty to the longer-term economic outlook. The extent to which the federal budget deficit would decline over coming years was an open question. As regards the current account balance, some participants noted that the sharp drop in net exports in November probably reflected transitory factors in large part, as well as reported measurement errors. However, there has been little hard evidence as yet of a strengthening in the growth of spending in our foreign trading partners or of substantial effects on net exports from previous dollar declines. As a result, the external imbalance seemed likely to remain elevated, with a high level of uncertainty surrounding the prospects for and path of adjustment.
