Industrial activity accelerated noticeably during the fourth quarter. The pickup of industrial production in December owed largely to increased motor vehicle assemblies and a turnaround in the output of utilities associated with cold weather across the northeast. Production of high-tech goods slowed slightly in the fourth quarter. Available weekly physical product data suggested that manufacturing production would increase moderately in January. Capacity utilization continued to climb through the end of the year but remained below its longer-run average.
