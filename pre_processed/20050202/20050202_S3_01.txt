In their discussion of the economic outlook, the meeting participants regarded incoming data since the last meeting as supporting their expectations that, with the further removal of monetary accommodation, GDP would likely grow at a moderate pace consistent with a gradual reduction of remaining economic slack, and inflation would probably continue to be low. Domestic demand had stayed strong through the fourth quarter and should continue to be bolstered by favorable financial conditions. Recent data indicated low and stable rates of core consumer inflation and apparently well-anchored inflation expectations. Against this backdrop, the risks to the outlook for both output and inflation relative to the Committee's goals appeared to remain well-balanced.
