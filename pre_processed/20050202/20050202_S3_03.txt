In their comments about developments in key sectors of the economy, meeting participants noted that, relative to several months ago, many firms now seemed somewhat more confident about the economic outlook. The anticipation of increased sales relative to existing production capacity and also desires to upgrade technology and improve competitiveness were leading firms to increase spending on equipment and software. Gains in capital spending had been quite strong last year, and while some of that spending might have been motivated by the year-end expiration of the partial-expensing provisions of the tax code, participants had seen little evidence to date that there would be a significant slowdown in the growth of spending in the early part of 2005. Low longer-term interest rates on corporate borrowing--reflecting in part narrow credit risk spreads--along with strong corporate profitability and improved balance sheets were continuing to support fairly brisk growth of capital expenditures. Low longer-term nominal interest rates were partly attributable to well-contained inflation expectations, but low real interest rates, along with slight declines in equity prices so far this year, might reflect lingering caution on the part of businesses about the outlook. Nevertheless, narrow credit spreads and risk premiums, along with abundant liquidity in financing markets, suggested that markets now assigned fairly low odds to significant downside risks.
