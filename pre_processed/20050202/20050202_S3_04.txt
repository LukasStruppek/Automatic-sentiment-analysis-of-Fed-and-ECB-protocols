Solid income gains, low interest rates, and consumer confidence were seen by participants as helping to sustain strong growth of household spending. Some firms had reported that holiday sales were higher than a year earlier and better than expected, while auto sales had responded strongly to incentives in December. The current low measured saving rate seemed mostly explainable by the strength of expected income gains, low interest rates, and the increase in household wealth resulting from the rise in equity and housing prices. Although the saving rate might well drift up over the next couple of years, participants generally thought it likely that consumer spending would continue growing at a strong pace. However, a marked slowing in home price appreciation and possible increases in longer-term interest rates, which would raise financing costs and reduce opportunities to extract equity from homes through refinancings and home equity loans, were seen as downside risks to the prospects for consumption spending and for housing construction.
