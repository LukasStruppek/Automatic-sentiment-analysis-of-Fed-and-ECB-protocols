Moderate increases in payroll employment during November and December pushed the average monthly advance in the quarter well above that of the third quarter. Employment gains were fairly widespread, with hiring in business services, health care, financial activities, and wholesale trade more than offsetting continued sluggishness in manufacturing and a seasonally adjusted decline in retail services during December. Surveys of employers hiring plans and job openings pointed to continued moderate gains in employment early this year. The average workweek during the fourth quarter was unchanged from the third quarter, and as a result aggregate hours decelerated despite the pickup in employment growth. The unemployment rate held steady at 5.4 percent in December.
