[' Mr. Broaddus dissented because he continued to believe that a modest tightening of policy would be prudent in light of the apparent persisting strength in aggregate demand for goods and services. He recognized the case for holding policy steady given recent developments in East Asian economies and financial markets; he believed, however, that a slight firming at this meeting would provide valuable insurance against the risk that demand growth might remain above a sustainable trend and require a sharper policy response later. He thought further that the potential benefits of this insurance outweighed the risk that such an action would have a significant negative impact on U.S. economic activity. He also believed that signaling a greater willingness to tolerate modest policy adjustments in response to emerging developments would foster more flexible movements in longer-term financial markets, and specifically enable longer-term interest rates to play their traditional role as automatic stabilizers for the economy more effectively.
