[" In foreign exchange markets, the value of the dollar rose over the intermeeting period in terms of both the trade-weighted index of the other G-10 currencies and the currencies of a number of Asian countries. The dollar's appreciation against the German mark and other Western European currencies appeared to reflect market perceptions that the prospects for monetary tightening had ebbed in those countries in light of the persistence of subdued inflation and indications that the continuing financial turmoil in Asian and other emerging economies was likely to have a retarding effect on the economies of the industrial countries. The dollar's appreciation relative to the yen appeared to reflect rising concerns about the Japanese economy in the wake of continuing financial difficulties in Japan and spillover effects from events elsewhere in Asia. The dollar strengthened further in this period against most of the other East Asian currencies, notably against the Korean won. "]
