[" With regard to the prospects for final demand in key sectors, the members noted that the appreciation of the dollar against a wide range of currencies, along with the prospective slackening in world economic expansion associated with the Asian turmoil, could be expected to exert a considerable damping effect on U.S. exports over the next several quarters. In addition, increased uncertainty about financial asset values, possibly related in part to further difficulties in Asia, could lead to greater caution in spending, while a substantial decline in equity values, should it occur, would have a more pronounced effect by reducing household wealth and raising the cost of equity capital. However, a number of members suggested that consumer spending might hold up relatively well if the effects of the Asian crisis on the U.S. economy were not markedly deeper or more prolonged than currently expected. To date, anecdotal reports indicated only scattered signs of weaker export demand, primarily some slackening in orders for and shipments of selected commodities such as agricultural goods and lumber and wood products, and there were few indications of reduced demand for manufactured goods. At the same time, business contacts were optimistic about holiday sales, tourism was booming in some parts of the country, and spending for services had been brisk. In the circumstances, continuing gains in wages and employment, the prevailing high levels of confidence, the cumulative effects of very large increases in household wealth in recent years, and the intense competition among retailers for the consumer's attention could promote substantial further growth in consumer expenditures. The same factors, along with the favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership, were maintaining housing demand at a relatively high level. "]
