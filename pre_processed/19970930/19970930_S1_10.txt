[' The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in July, reflecting both a decline in exports and a rise in imports. The lower exports of goods and services were associated with decreases in most trade categories and left total exports slightly below their relatively high level of the second quarter. The July increase in imports also was spread among nearly all trade categories and brought total imports of goods and services to a level somewhat above the average for the second quarter. The available information suggested that economic activity expanded further in recent months in all the major foreign industrial countries except Japan. Growth remained relatively robust in Canada and the United Kingdom, and activity apparently picked up in France and Germany after having been sluggish early in the year. Economic activity in Japan declined appreciably in the second quarter, and more recent information provided little clear evidence of subsequent strength. ']
