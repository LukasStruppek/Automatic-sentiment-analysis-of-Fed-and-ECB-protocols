[' The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth of economic activity remains brisk. In labor markets, hiring continued robust over the summer months and the civilian unemployment rate, at 4.9 percent in August, remained near its low for the current economic expansion. Industrial production increased considerably further in July and August. Retail sales have risen sharply over recent months after a pause during the spring. Housing starts declined in July and August, but home sales have been strong. Business fixed investment has increased substantially further since mid-year and available indicators point to further sizable gains in coming months. After narrowing somewhat in the second quarter, the nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in July. Inventory investment in July was well below the average pace in prior months of 1997. Price inflation has remained subdued and increases in labor compensation have been moderate in recent months. ']
