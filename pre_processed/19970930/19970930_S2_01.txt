[' The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would expand at a pace significantly above that anticipated earlier for the second half of the year and the early part of 1998, but economic growth was likely to moderate appreciably to a more sustainable rate later. In the near term, business fixed investment appeared to be providing surprisingly strong impetus to income growth, and rising levels of wealth were stimulating robust consumer demand. With sales so strong, the downward adjustment in inventory investment that had been anticipated in the previous staff forecast seemed likely to occur more gradually. The projected strength in aggregate demand appeared likely to intensify pressures on resources and lead to some pickup in inflation. Less accommodative financial market conditions were anticipated to damp these tendencies over time. ']
