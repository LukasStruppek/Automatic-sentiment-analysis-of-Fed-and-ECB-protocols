[" In foreign exchange markets, the dollar experienced mixed changes in relation to major foreign currencies, largely reflecting diverging economic developments abroad. On balance, the dollar's trade-weighted value in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat over the intermeeting period. The dollar was down considerably against the mark as data suggesting a pickup in German economic activity and inflation led to market speculation concerning a possible increase in short-term German interest rates. The dollar also registered sizable declines over the period against a number of other European currencies. On the other hand, the dollar rose appreciably in relation to the Japanese yen, which came under selling pressure against the background of continuing sluggish economic conditions in Japan, persistent problems in its financial system, and concerns about the potential effect on Japan of the recent depreciations of Southeast Asian currencies. The dollar also strengthened somewhat in terms of the British pound, in part as a result of some indications that economic activity in the United Kingdom was not as strong as expected and the sizable declines that had occurred recently in that nation's long-term interest rates.
