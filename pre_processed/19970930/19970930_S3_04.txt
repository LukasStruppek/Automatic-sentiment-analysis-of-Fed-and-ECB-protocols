[" In the Committee's discussion of the prospects for inflation, members discussed the relative absence of price pressures in an environment of increasingly tight labor markets across the country and rising levels of manufacturing capacity utilization. In labor markets, costs were increasing much less than would have been expected on the basis of previous experience under similarly tight conditions. Among the possible explanations for this outcome were persisting concerns about job security; the muted rise in worker benefits, notably health care; and the increasing use by employers of more flexible and innovative means to attract and retain workers that were in high demand. Moreover, it was suggested that, at least in manufacturing, productivity had risen unusually rapidly of late, allowing corporations to hold the line on prices despite increases in labor costs. While the underlying reasons for the favorable inflation trends were not entirely clear, the members noted that, in addition to subdued increases in labor costs, the appreciation of the dollar and the relatively sluggish performance of many foreign industrial economies seemed to be contributing to the better-than-expected inflation performance by holding down prices in world commodity markets and prices of imported goods more generally. These developments also added to competitive pressures on businesses, which together with customer resistance were making it very difficult for firms to raise prices to reflect their higher costs. "]
