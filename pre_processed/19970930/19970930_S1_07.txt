[' Retail sales were up substantially over the summer after having edged lower during the spring. The upturn in recent months included a rebound in sales at automotive dealers following some weakness in earlier months. Sales at non-auto durable and at nondurable goods stores also strengthened after having declined on balance during the second quarter. The pickup in consumer spending occurred against a backdrop of further strong gains in incomes and household net worth that, according to recent surveys, had fostered high levels of consumer confidence. In addition, credit continued to be readily available to most consumers. Total private housing starts and building permits declined in August to levels somewhat below their averages in earlier months of the year, but data on overall home sales and builder ratings of new home sales continued to suggest that demand for single-family housing was still relatively buoyant.
