[' Industrial production increased considerably in July and August, extending a relatively brisk advance over the first half of the year. The output of business equipment rose strongly over the two months, with sizable gains in all major categories, and the output of consumer nondurables turned up after having displayed some weakness in earlier months of the year. The production of consumer durables also increased on balance over the two months. After rising somewhat in other recent months, the utilization of total manufacturing capacity was up appreciably in August, reaching its highest level since the spring of 1995. ']
