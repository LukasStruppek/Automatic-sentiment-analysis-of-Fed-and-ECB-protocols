In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance consistent with the federal funds rate continuing to average about 6-1/2 percent. Despite clear indications of a more moderate expansion in economic activity, persisting risks of heightened inflation pressures remained a policy concern, particularly in the context of an evident, if gradual, uptrend in key measures of core inflation. Indeed, a few members commented that measures of core inflation already were near or slightly above levels that they viewed as acceptable for the longer run. Although overall financial conditions had tightened over the course of recent months and currently appeared to be holding down the growth in spending, this added restraint was likely to be necessary to contain inflation pressures. In these circumstances, all the members saw the maintenance of a steady policy as the best course at this juncture to promote the Committee's longer-run objectives of price stability and sustainable economic expansion.
