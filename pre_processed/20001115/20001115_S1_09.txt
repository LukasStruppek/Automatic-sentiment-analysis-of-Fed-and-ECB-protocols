The pace of inventory investment slowed considerably in the third quarter. However, for a second consecutive quarter, the book value of inventories rose faster than sales, and inventory overhangs were evident in some industries. In manufacturing, stock accumulation edged up and the aggregate stock-shipments ratio in September, though still quite low by historic norms, was just above the middle of its range over the preceding twelve months. In the wholesale sector, inventory accumulation dropped in the third quarter; however, sales declined and the aggregate inventory-sales ratio for the sector was at the top of its narrow range over the past year. Retail stockbuilding also slowed in the third quarter, with much of the drop reflecting reductions in motor vehicle inventories at auto dealers. The aggregate inventory-sales ratio for this sector edged lower and was near the middle of its range over the past year.
