The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth had slowed appreciably from the rapid pace in the first half of the year. The slowdown was most apparent in housing construction and business investment in equipment and software, while consumer spending remained on a relatively solid upward trend. With expansion of aggregate demand less robust, industrial production and employment were rising at appreciably slower rates, though unemployment remained very low. Core inflation appeared to be increasing, but very gradually and in part reflecting the indirect effects of higher energy costs.
