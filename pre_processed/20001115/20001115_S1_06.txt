Nominal retail sales edged up in October after rising substantially in the third quarter. Nondurable goods stores, notably apparel, registered a sizable increase in October sales, but that gain was more than offset by declines in outlays for durable goods, particularly motor vehicles. Consumer spending for services continued to grow at a moderate rate through September (latest data). Recent consumer buying patterns seemed to reflect moderate growth of real disposable income in recent quarters and still generally buoyant consumer sentiment.
