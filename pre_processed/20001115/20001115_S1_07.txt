Single-family housing starts declined further in the third quarter as a whole. Nevertheless, the drop in interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages since mid-May might have sparked the slight increase, on balance, in single-family housing starts in August and September and the upturn in new home sales in the third quarter. After a strong first half, multifamily starts dropped in the third quarter despite low vacancy rates and rising apartment rents.
