Even limited slowing in the expansion of investment expenditures could be expected to have retarding effects on the growth of consumer income and spending. While such spending had held up well in the third quarter, the limited information available on more recent developments suggested some softening, though the data were not conclusive. Factors cited in support of a somewhat weaker trajectory in consumer spending included the impact of elevated energy costs, the high debt burdens of many households, and the ebbing of the wealth effects from strong earlier gains in stock market prices. Even so, anticipated increases in employment and income and still relatively high levels of consumer confidence were likely to support appreciable further growth in consumer spending, albeit probably at a rate somewhat below the brisk pace of the past few years.
