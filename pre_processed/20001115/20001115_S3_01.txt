In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that the information that had become available since the previous meeting had reinforced earlier indications of appreciable slowing in the expansion of economic activity. The cumulating evidence of moderating expansion seemed especially clear in the information on employment growth and manufacturing output. Aggregate demand currently appeared to be growing at a pace a little below the rate of increase in the economy's output potential, a configuration that could well persist in coming quarters. Actual and expected shortfalls in business profitability had led to tighter credit conditions for many borrowers and lower equity prices, which would continue to restrain spending; moreover, further pressure on profit margins, with adverse effects on financial markets, business investment, and consumer spending, was a distinct possibility. Members observed, however, that economic growth had rebounded sharply from temporary slowdowns previously in the current expansion, and several noted the possibility that a less restrictive fiscal policy stance would be bolstering demand in the years ahead.
