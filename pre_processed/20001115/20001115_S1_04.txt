Growth in private nonfarm payroll employment slowed in October from the moderate September rate; since midyear, employment growth had been considerably lower than earlier in the year. The falloff in growth was concentrated in the manufacturing, retail trade, and temporary help services industries. By contrast, the pace of hiring was brisk in real estate and construction and slowed only slightly in services industries other than temporary help. The civilian unemployment rate held at its current cyclical low of 3.9 percent in October.
