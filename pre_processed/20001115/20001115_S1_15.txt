The broad monetary aggregates decelerated in October. The slower growth of M2 followed strong expansion in August and September, however, and growth since midyear was at about the same pace as in the first half of the year. M3 also increased at a slower rate in October, partly reflecting weakness in bank lending and declines in bank holdings of securities. The growth of domestic nonfinancial debt picked up in September in association with an increase in the pace of private borrowing and a less rapid paydown of federal debt.
