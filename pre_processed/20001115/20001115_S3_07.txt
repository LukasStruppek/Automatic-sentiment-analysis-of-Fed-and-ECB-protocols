Current forecasts of appreciable growth in foreign economic activity had favorable implications for U.S. exports and the nation's trade balance, but some members expressed concern about financial and economic weakness in a number of foreign economies. Failure to remedy structural and other problems in some countries incurred the risk of economic and financial distress, with possible spillover effects on other economies and financial markets. While those risks seemed small, they might be difficult to contain. The exchange value of the dollar was another source of uncertainty for the outlook. In the view of some members, the dollar could well come under downward pressure as the nation's current account deficits continued to cumulate. A lower dollar would tend to have a favorable effect on the trade deficit but also would add to inflationary pressures in the domestic economy.
