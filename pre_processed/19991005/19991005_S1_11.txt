Inflation remained relatively moderate, though somewhat above the pace of 1998 because of a sharp rebound in energy prices. Overall consumer prices increased in July and August at about the second-quarter rate. Abstracting from the sharp advances in energy prices and the mild increases in food prices, consumer inflation continued to be relatively subdued over the two months. In the past twelve months, the core CPI rose less than in the previous twelve-month period. At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy were essentially unchanged over the two months; moreover, the change in core producer prices in the past year was about the same as in the year-earlier period. At earlier stages of processing, however, producer prices of crude and intermediate materials excluding food and energy had firmed noticeably over recent months. Average hourly earnings continued to grow at a moderate pace over July and August, and the rise over the past year was considerably smaller than that for the year-earlier period.
