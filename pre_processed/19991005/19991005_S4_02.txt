On the issue of the tilt in the Committee's directive, a majority of the members favored associating an unchanged policy stance with a directive that was biased toward restraint. These members did not anticipate that intermeeting developments would require policy to be tightened during the weeks immediately ahead, but they believed that the Committee probably would need to move to a less accommodative policy stance in the relatively near future, possibly at the November meeting. They also believed that, given the Committee's recently adopted practice of immediately announcing its decisions to change the symmetry of the directive, an asymmetrical directive would help convey the message that policy adjustments might not yet be completed for the balance of this year and that the Committee remained concerned about potential inflationary developments in coming months. Other members, while generally agreeing that the risks pointed on balance to some rise in inflation over time, nonetheless were quite uncertain about the timing of any additional firming in monetary policy and preferred to leave the Committee's possible future course of action more open. Even so, they could accept an asymmetric directive in light of the consensus that had emerged at this meeting in favor of an unchanged policy stance.
