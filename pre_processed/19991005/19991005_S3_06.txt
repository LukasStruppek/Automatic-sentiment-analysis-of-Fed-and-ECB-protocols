The prospects for business inventories over coming months were difficult to evaluate, with the usual uncertainties accentuated by century date change effects. According to fragmentary information, inventory investment picked up during the summer months from a very low pace in the second quarter. To some extent, the recent strengthening may have reflected precautionary stockbuilding as insurance against potential supply disruptions relating to the century date change. Such stockbuilding might well intensify during the closing months of the year and be reversed early next year, with effects of uncertain magnitude on overall economic activity in that period. Looking beyond such a swing, business inventories, which currently appeared to be near desired levels in most industries, were projected to grow at a moderate pace broadly in line with the expansion in final sales.
