At its meeting on August 24, 1999, the Committee adopted a directive that called for a slight tightening of conditions in reserve markets consistent with an increase of 0.25 percentage point in the federal funds rate to an average of around 5-1/4 percent. The members noted that this move, together with the firming in June, should help to keep inflation subdued and to promote sustainable economic expansion. The Committee also agreed that the directive should be symmetric. A possible rise in inflation remained the main threat to sustained economic expansion, but it was not anticipated that further tightening would be needed in the near term and there would be time to gather substantially more information about the balance of risks relating to trends in aggregate demand and supply.
