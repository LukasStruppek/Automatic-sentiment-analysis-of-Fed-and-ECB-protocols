Manufacturing and trade inventories, outside of motor vehicles, picked up sharply in July after posting a small increase in the first half of the year, but inventories remained lean in relation to sales. In manufacturing, stocks rebounded from a substantial June decline; however, the aggregate stocks-shipments ratio remained at the bottom of its range for the past twelve months. Wholesalers also increased their inventories in July; while the inventory-shipments ratio for this sector rose, it was in the low end of its range for the past year. In the retail sector, inventories contracted somewhat in July, and the inventory-sales ratio for this sector also was near the bottom of its range over the past year.
