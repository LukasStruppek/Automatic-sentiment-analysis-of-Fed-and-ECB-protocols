Despite a further rise in opportunity costs, M2 and M3 continued to grow at moderate rates in August and evidently in September as well. Expansion of these two monetary aggregates was supported by further rapid expansion in the demand for currency and stronger inflows to retail money market funds at a time of weakness in U.S. bond and equity markets. In addition, growth of M3 was sustained by large flows into institution-only money market funds as the yields on those funds caught up to earlier increases in short-term market rates. For the year through September, M2 was estimated to have increased at a rate somewhat above the Committee's annual range and M3 at a rate just above the upper end of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range.
