In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar changed little over the period in relation to the currencies of a broad group of important U.S. trading partners. The dollar depreciated against the currencies of the major foreign industrial countries, especially the Japanese yen, in response to generally stronger-than-expected incoming data on spending and production in those countries. However, the dollar rose against the currencies of the other important trading partners in the broad group, reflecting sizable declines in the currencies of several countries in Latin America and Asia.
