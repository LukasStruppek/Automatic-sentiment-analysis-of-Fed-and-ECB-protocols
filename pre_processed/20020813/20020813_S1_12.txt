At its meeting on June 25-26, 2002, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the intended level of the federal funds rate at 1-3/4 percent, and it also retained a neutral balance of risks statement. There was little market reaction to the Committee's rate decision or its statement. Instead, market participants focused their attention on further revelations of corporate malfeasance, fears that more earnings restatements would be announced in the run-up to the August 14 deadline for certifying corporate financial statements, and concerns that second-half corporate earnings might prove disappointing. In this environment, equity prices plunged before recovering somewhat later in the intermeeting period; on net, the major broad equity indexes were down substantially. Yields on Treasury securities also fell markedly on balance in volatile trading, as investors sought a safe haven for their funds and trimmed their expectations about the path for the intended federal funds rate in coming quarters. However, doubts about corporate balance sheets and the prospects for earnings growth led to steep increases in corporate debt yields, particularly for lower-quality issues.
