The outlook for inflation remained very favorable in the context of continuing slack in labor markets and robust growth in structural productivity. Under these conditions, increases in trend unit labor costs were likely to remain subdued over the next several quarters despite likely further escalation in the cost of worker healthcare benefits. Indeed, the risks of any significant run-up in inflation appeared to have receded, and more time than anticipated earlier was likely to elapse before the expansion reached a pace that would begin to reduce margins of underutilized labor and other producer resources. Even so, examples of rising cost and price pressures were not entirely absent. In addition to healthcare insurance costs, these pressures included insurance costs more generally, steel prices, some materials costs, and, in association with the dollar's depreciation, some upward pressures on import prices. On balance and barring a major supply shock to the economy, members saw little reason for concern about the prospect of an increase in inflation in the foreseeable future.
