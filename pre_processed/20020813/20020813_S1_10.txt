The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened further in May and for the April-May period. The expansion of the deficit over the two months reflected a sharp rise in the value of imports that exceeded a sizable gain in the value of exports. The step-up in imports was spread widely across almost all the major trade categories, with notable increases in motor vehicles, consumer goods, and machinery. The advance in exports was primarily in automotive parts, industrial supplies, and capital equipment. With regard to economic activity abroad, the available information, which is released in many cases only with a considerable lag, indicated that foreign economic output generally continued to rebound during the first half of the year, though the pace of recovery was uneven across regions and countries. Growth was strong in Canada, the United Kingdom, and emerging Asia, but expansion in the euro area and Japan remained sluggish, owing to continued weakness in final domestic demand. In South America, economic and financial conditions had deteriorated significantly during the intermeeting period, especially in Brazil and Uruguay, and economic activity remained particularly weak in Argentina and Venezuela.
