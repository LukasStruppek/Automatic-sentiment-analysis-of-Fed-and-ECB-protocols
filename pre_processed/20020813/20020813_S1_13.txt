In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar changed little on balance in terms of the major foreign currencies over the intermeeting period, though early in the period the dollar declined sharply against those currencies amid further disclosures of U.S. corporate accounting irregularities and concerns about the strength of the U.S. recovery. Against the background of a similar combination of disappointing concerns, European stock prices dropped more than those in the United States, while Japanese equity prices declined less as incoming data seemed to point to a mild pickup of economic activity in Japan. Across all the major industrial economies, investors tended to shift funds toward less risky instruments and to lower their expectations for policy rates. The dollar also was little changed on balance against the index of currencies of other important trading partners, even though several South American countries were experiencing difficult financial and political problems.
