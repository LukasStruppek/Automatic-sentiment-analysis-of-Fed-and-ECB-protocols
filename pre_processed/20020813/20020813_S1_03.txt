The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that economic activity expanded only slightly in the second quarter. Businesses added a bit to their inventory positions after an extended period of sizable declines, but final sales changed little: business capital spending weakened somewhat further while growth in consumer spending, residential housing expenditures, and government outlays slowed. The scant information available for the third quarter, principally July's very strong motor vehicle sales, suggested that domestic demand was still recovering but relatively sluggishly. Industrial production had continued to advance since the first quarter, but the demand for labor services had increased only slightly and the unemployment rate had risen. Importantly, labor productivity continued on a strong upward trend. Overall price inflation had fallen sharply over the past year, largely reflecting developments in the food and energy sectors, and core inflation had eased a little.
