[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. In labor markets, hiring remained robust at midyear, and the civilian unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in July, matched its low for the current economic expansion. Industrial production increased relatively slowly in July, owing in part to a temporary drop in motor vehicle assemblies. Retail sales rose briskly in June and July after having changed little over the preceding three months. Housing starts rebounded in June and July after having weakened in May. Business fixed investment increased substantially further in the second quarter and available indicators point to further sizable gains in the current quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed slightly on balance over April and May from its downward-revised average rate in the first quarter. Price inflation has remained subdued and increases in labor compensation have been moderate. ']
