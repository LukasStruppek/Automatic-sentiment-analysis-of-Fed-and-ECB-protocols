[" By notation vote completed on August 20, 1997, the Committee approved for public comment a revision of its Rules Regarding the Availability of Information. The purpose of the revision is to bring the rules into conformance with the Electronic Freedom of Information Act of 1996 (EFOIA), which amends the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The revision does not incorporate any substantive changes in the rules other than to conform them to the requirements of EFOIA and to update and clarify the Committee's procedures for processing FOIA requests. After review of the comments that are received from the public, the Committee will issue the rules in final form on or before October 2, 1997. "]
