[' M2 expanded at a moderate pace over June and July after having fluctuated sharply in April and May as a result of tax-related flows. Data for early August suggested a somewhat faster rate of M2 growth in association with heavier inflows to retail money funds; the latter might have been related to heightened demand for liquidity as a result of recently higher volatility in bond and equity markets. For the year through July, M2 expanded at a rate near the upper bound of its range. M3 also fluctuated sharply over April and May and grew at a relatively moderate rate in June. M3 surged in July, however, as heavy volumes of large time deposits were issued by U.S. branches of foreign banks to pay down borrowings from their overseas offices and by domestic banks to counter the runoff of government deposit accounts; the latter two sources of funds are not included in M3. For the year through July, M3 expanded at a rate appreciably above the upper bound of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had continued to expand in recent months at a rate near the middle of its range. ']
