[" In the Committee's discussion of the prospects for inflation, members commented that a number of factors could be cited to explain the persistence of relatively subdued inflation this year despite high levels of resource use. Among those factors were the appreciation of the dollar and its effects on prices of imports and competing domestic products, a significant decline in world oil prices, the relatively sluggish performance of many foreign economies that had tended to moderate prices of products traded in world markets, and relatively large grain harvests in the United States that had curbed pressures on food prices. However, the underlying reasons for the favorable price trends were not entirely clear. Labor costs were still rising appreciably less than would have been expected on the basis of past experience under similarly tight labor market conditions. Explanations tended to focus on the concerns about job security felt by many workers, the muted rise in the costs of worker benefits, notably for health care, and the increased use of innovative and highly targeted methods of compensation. With regard to the market pricing of goods, businesses tended to cite highly competitive conditions across the nation that made it very difficult to raise prices and gave impetus to efforts to improve productivity. Indeed, the available evidence suggested that the profits of business concerns generally had continued to increase in the second quarter, implying that productivity had been rising at a pace that exceeded published estimates by a significant margin.
