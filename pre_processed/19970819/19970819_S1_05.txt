[' Private nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in July after a June increase that was below the average for earlier months of the year. The step-up in job growth in July reflected substantially larger job gains in business services, retail trade, and the finance, insurance, and real estate industries. A small decline in manufacturing jobs roughly offset slightly higher employment in construction. The civilian unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in July, matched its low for the current economic expansion. ']
