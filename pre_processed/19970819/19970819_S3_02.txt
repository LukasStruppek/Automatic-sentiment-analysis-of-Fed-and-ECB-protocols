[' The uncertain prospects for inventory investment were a dominant factor in the outlook for economic activity over the nearer term. The accumulation of inventories had been unusually high in the second quarter according to the available evidence. There was no broad sense of an undesired buildup, but the rate of inventory investment would have to be reined in if an overhang were to be averted. A concern in this regard was that the apparent upturn in final demand, particularly if it proved to be somewhat stronger than currently expected, and related business optimism about sales prospects might well result in a further buildup of inventories at a relatively rapid rate. While such a development was not viewed as the most likely outcome and, indeed, less-than-projected strength in the inventory sector could not be ruled out, relatively rapid inventory accumulation in the context of persisting above-trend growth in final demand would generate additional pressure on resources and heighten the risks of accelerating inflation.
