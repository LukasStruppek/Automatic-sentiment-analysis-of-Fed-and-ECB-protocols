[' Net exports were seen as another constraining factor in the performance of the economy next year. On the import side, even moderate expansion in domestic economic activity was likely to stimulate appreciable further growth in U. S. demands for foreign goods. At the same time, the prospects for exports to a number of major industrial countries were not promising, at least for the nearer term, given lagging economies in Europe and Japan. In this connection a number of members referred to reports of weak export demand for specific U.S. products and also noted that an extended coal mining strike had cut supplies of coal available for export and had induced some domestic firms to turn to imports to help fill their requirements. On the other hand, some markets for U.S. exports, notably those in a number of East Asian nations and some Latin American countries, were likely to continue to experience considerable growth, thereby mitigating an otherwise fairly gloomy outlook for exports.
