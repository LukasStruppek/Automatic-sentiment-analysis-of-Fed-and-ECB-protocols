[' Industrial production rose sharply in October, with manufacturing more than accounting for the increase. Part of the gain in manufacturing reflected a further rebound in the output of motor vehicles and parts. Aside from motor vehicles, however, the production of business equipment was lifted by another surge in office and computing equipment, and the output of consumer goods was boosted by strength in furniture and appliances. Utilization of total industrial capacity rose in October, reaching a level last seen in the fourth quarter of 1992. ']
