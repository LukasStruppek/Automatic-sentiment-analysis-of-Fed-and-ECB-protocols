[' The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit declined further in August, but for July and August combined the deficit was about the same as its average rate for the second quarter. The value of both exports and imports was slightly lower in July-August than in the second quarter. The decline in the value of exports primarily reflected shortfalls in shipments of aircraft and automotive products, and the drop in imports was associated with reduced imports of oil and automotive products. Available data indicated that the performance of the major foreign industrial economies continued to be mixed. Economic activity appeared to have remained weak in Japan in the third quarter and to have stagnated in western Germany after increasing moderately in the second quarter. On the other hand, the recessions in France and Italy seemed to have bottomed out, and the economies of Canada and the United Kingdom to have recovered somewhat further. ']
