[" At this meeting the Committee considered a number of alternatives for releasing detailed information on its deliberations at past and future meetings. Members emphasized that the most important consideration was the preservation of a deliberative process that would enable the Committee to arrive at the best possible monetary policy decisions. Premature release of detailed information, such as transcripts, would sharply curtail the Committee's ability to freely discuss evolving economic and financial trends and alternative policy responses. Moreover, if full transcripts were subject to release before many years had passed, much vital information obtained in confidence could not be discussed in meetings and in any event probably would not be made available by foreign central banks, business firms, and other sources.
