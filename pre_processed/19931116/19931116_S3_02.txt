[' In their assessment of developments underlying the economic outlook, members referred to indications in many areas of some strengthening in business conditions and in related business sentiment, though economic activity clearly remained sluggish or even depressed in some parts of the country and overall business attitudes could still be described as cautious. Current financial conditions, including the strength in equity markets, reduced intermediate- and long-term interest rates, and an apparently improving availability of business credit from financial institutions, provided a favorable backdrop for further economic expansion. Moreover, businesses and households had made substantial progress in improving their financial positions. These factors were seen as reducing downside risks to the expansion. At the same time, while there were signs of significant firming in the economic expansion, a number of members observed that at this point they did not see the usual indications of any near-term intensification of inflationary pressures such as general increases in commodity prices, lengthening delivery lead times along with efforts to increase inventories, and strong growth of credit. Indeed, the risks of an overheated and inflationary expansion in the near term seemed quite limited in light of various constraints on the economy such as those associated with a restrictive fiscal policy and the continuing weakness in key export markets.
