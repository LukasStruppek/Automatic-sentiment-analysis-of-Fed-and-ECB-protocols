[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests some strengthening in the expansion of economic activity in recent months. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably in September and October, while the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 6.8 percent in October. Industrial production increased sharply in October, partly reflecting a continuing rebound in the output of motor vehicles. Retail sales were up substantially in October after changing little in September. Housing activity picked up further in the third quarter. The expansion of business capital spending has slowed from a robust pace earlier in the year. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in July-August was about unchanged from its average rate in the second quarter. Consumer prices have increased moderately on balance in recent months and producer prices have fallen. ']
