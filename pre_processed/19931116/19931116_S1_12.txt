[' Producer prices for finished goods fell in October, retracing the small increase in September; excluding the effects of higher prices for finished foods and energy goods, producer prices were down over the September-October period. Over the twelve-month period ended in October, producer prices for nonfood, non-energy finished goods were fractionally higher on balance, the lowest yearly increase on record for this index, which was introduced in 1973. Consumer prices rose in October after being unchanged in September, with the increase partly reflecting the effect of the implementation of the new federal gasoline tax. For nonfood, non-energy consumer items, the rise in consumer prices over the twelve months ended in October was considerably smaller than the rise over the comparable period ended in October 1992. Labor compensation costs did not show a comparable downtrend. The increase in hourly compensation for private industry workers in the third quarter was about the same as in the second quarter. For the twelve months ended in September, hourly compensation advanced slightly faster than over the comparable year-earlier period. ']
