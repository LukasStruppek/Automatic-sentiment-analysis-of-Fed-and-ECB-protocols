[" With respect to the interval between a meeting and release of a lightly edited transcript, all of the Committee members were concerned that the absence of a substantial lag would seriously harm the Committee's ongoing deliberative process. Many also commented that the absence of a substantial lag would be unfair to meeting participants who had been unaware that their remarks would be released and were unable to review the transcripts for accuracy. Various members argued for lags that ranged from 3 years to 10 years or more, but a majority felt that a 5-year lag was necessary in order to prevent harm to the Committee's ongoing deliberations. The other members indicated that a 5-year lag was acceptable because it represented a reasonable balance among the various considerations. "]
