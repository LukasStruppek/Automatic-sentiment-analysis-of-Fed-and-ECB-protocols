In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, the members commented that the information that had become available since the December meeting had tended to validate their earlier assessment that the expansion was firmly established and that robust economic growth, under way since about mid 2003, was likely to continue as the year progressed. Many emphasized that business expenditures now appeared to be on a solid upward trajectory amid widespread reports of much improved business sentiment. Indeed, business expenditures had broadened the sources of significant strength in the expansion, which earlier had been sustained mainly by household and government spending. Factors underlying a favorable outlook for economic activity continued to include stimulative fiscal and monetary policies, accommodative conditions in financial markets, and the positive effects of a strong uptrend in productivity on business investment incentives and, with some lag, on household incomes. The members nonetheless expressed disappointment that the acceleration in economic activity had thus far failed to generate significant strengthening in employment, though they pointed to a number of positive signs in labor markets. Given their expectations of persisting above-trend economic growth, they saw increasing demand for workers as a likely prospect going forward. Regarding the outlook for inflation, members observed that wide margins of slack in labor and product markets continued to hold down wages and prices, especially given the concurrent strength in productivity. Core consumer inflation appeared to have drifted lower recently, and a number of members mentioned the possibility of a modest further decline in such inflation from its current subdued level. Over the year ahead, however, the members generally anticipated little net change in consumer price inflation.
