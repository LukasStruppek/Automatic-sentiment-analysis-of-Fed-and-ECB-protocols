With regard to the wording of the Committee’s press statement to be released shortly after the meeting, members discussed at some length the desirability of retaining a reference from earlier statements to the prospect that an accommodative policy could be maintained “for a considerable period.” The existing language had been explicitly qualified at the December meeting by tying it to low inflation and slack in resource use, thereby underscoring the notion that a move away from the current degree of policy accommodation would depend on economic conditions rather than simply on the passage of time. All the members agreed that a change in wording was desirable, not to signal a policy tightening move in the near term, but rather to increase the Committee’s flexibility to take such an action when it was deemed to be desirable and to underline that any such decision would be made on the basis of evolving economic conditions. However, some differences of opinion arose with regard to the specific proposal under consideration, namely to remove the reference to “considerable period” and to substitute one referring to “patience.” Those who fully endorsed the proposal believed that the new wording conveyed important information about the Committee’s strategy in an environment of price stability and economic slack and under those circumstances was unlikely to have outsized effects in financial markets. A number of members commented that expectations of sustained policy accommodation appeared to have contributed to valuations in financial markets that left little room for downside risks, and the change in wording might prompt those markets to adjust more appropriately to changing economic circumstances in the future. A few members, while expressing agreement with respect to the merits of a language change, nonetheless preferred to drop the reference to a “considerable period’’ entirely without substituting a reference to the Committee’s ability to be patient. In this view, even the replacement language would tend to shape expectations in ways that could complicate the conduct of policy, and with the economy in a strong uptrend, the Committee no longer needed to utilize such special language.
