In their discussion of developments across the nation, members emphasized growing indications of rising business confidence and, despite persisting softness in a number of industries, more widespread signs of increasing business spending for equipment and software and for inventories. The members cited a variety of factors that pointed to a further pickup in business capital expenditures over the coming year, including the strength in new orders and shipments, increasing profits and cash flow, the improved financial condition of many business firms, the general availability of financing on favorable terms, and the temporary tax incentive on expenditures for new equipment. Anecdotal reports from business contacts about capital spending plans were indicative of appreciable further acceleration in business expenditures on a widening range of capital goods. While many contacts indicated that replacement demand or the cost-saving opportunities provided by more productive new equipment were still the driving factors in guiding investment decisions, there were more reports of investment spending to expand capacity.
