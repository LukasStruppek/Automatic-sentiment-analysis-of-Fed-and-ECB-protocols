Prices of consumer goods and services other than food and energy continued to decelerate through the end of 2003. Overall consumer prices were flat, on balance, over the past three months, as a small increase in core prices and a large rise in food prices were offset by a sizable drop in energy prices. Over the year, the consumer price index posted a moderate increase that was noticeably below that in the previous year. Core consumer prices decelerated more sharply and rose only slightly over the year. Producer prices for finished goods were up moderately over the year, and the advance was substantially above that over the previous year. The rise last year was due almost entirely to substantial increases in food and energy prices as core producer prices rose only a little after having edged down over 2002. With regard to labor costs, the average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose modestly in the twelve months ending in December, an increase somewhat below that over 2002.
