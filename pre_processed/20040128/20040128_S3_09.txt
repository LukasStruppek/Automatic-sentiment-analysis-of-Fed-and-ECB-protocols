In the Committee's discussion of the outlook for inflation, the members agreed that increases in core consumer prices were likely to remain muted this year, with ongoing strength in the expansion only gradually reducing the current output gap and anticipated gains in productivity exerting downward pressure on costs and prices. Some members commented, however, that the relationship between the output gap and inflation was quite loose and that the outlook for productivity remained uncertain. Accordingly, while members agreed that changes in core consumer price inflation were likely to be limited, there was some divergence of opinion about the most probable direction. In the view of many, some modest further disinflation appeared to be the most likely prospect. A few members noted that such disinflation, if it was associated with rapid growth in productivity, could be viewed as non-threatening. Moreover, the expected strength in aggregate demand would curb the extent of disinflation over time. A few members expressed the differing view that core consumer prices might well edge up over the course of the year in light of the considerable stimulus stemming from current monetary and fiscal policies and the possibility that the expected pickup in economic activity and employment, especially if it were on the high side of current forecasts, would be associated with slower growth in productivity. The evidence pointing to the possibility of an uptick in inflation was still quite limited, but some members noted that in addition to sizable advances in the prices of many commodities including oil, reports from business contacts indicated that a few firms had been able to raise their selling prices and maintain them at higher levels in an effort to pass on increases in costs. Overall, however, the pricing power of business firms remained quite limited.
