In keeping with the practice at meetings preceding the Federal Reserveâ€™s semi-annual report to the Congress on the economy and monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks had provided individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and consumer price inflation for the year 2004. The forecasts pointed to a continuation of relatively vigorous growth in economic activity, some further decline in unemployment, and a quite low rate of inflation. Specifically, the forecasts of the expansion in real GDP between the fourth quarter of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2004 had a central tendency of 4-1/2 to 5 percent and a full range of 4 to 5-1/2 percent. The projections of the civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2004 were all in a range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. Forecasts of consumer price inflation for the year, as measured by the PCE chain-type price index, were centered in a range of 1 to 1-1/4 percent, with a full range of 1 to 1-1/2 percent.
