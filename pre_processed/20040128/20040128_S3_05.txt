While business expenditures had turned up, employers had continued to display a high degree of caution in hiring new workers. Employment had trended up since mid-2003 after a protracted period of job losses, but the gains were significantly weaker than was typical at similar stages of earlier business cycles. A key factor that had tended to hold down hiring was the continuing ability of business firms to meet increasing demand by improving productivity with existing workforces rather than hiring new workers. Against this background, labor markets continued to be described as soft in most areas, albeit with more signs of at least modest improvement. In this regard, members referred to positive developments such as the decline in initial claims and the rise in aggregate hours worked in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, the members saw considerably faster growth in employment as a likely prospect in the context of further strengthening in aggregate demand and expectations of some slowing in the growth of productivity from its extraordinary pace in recent quarters. Several emphasized, however, that the timing and extent of the improvement in employment were subject to considerable uncertainty.
