A portion of this discussion focused on the report of a working group that had been directed to study how the Committee's announcements might be improved. In the course of the discussion, members stressed the importance that they attached to conveying clearly to the public information regarding the reasons for policy decisions and how those decisions related to the Committee's longer-term objectives. However, only limited support emerged for the use of particular standard wording to express the Committee's appraisals of the economic outlook and views about the balance of risks. Indeed, several members were in favor of discontinuing the use of statements regarding the balance of risks to the outlook and instead focusing mostly on the reasons for their policy decisions in the announcement. At the same time, all the members indicated that they could support a flexible approach in which the wording of the Committee's announcements, including the assessment of the balance of risks going forward, would be adjusted gradually over time in keeping with evolving economic conditions.
