The available data suggested that business purchases of transportation equipment strengthened in the fourth quarter and that spending on other capital goods advanced at a moderate pace. Business expenditures on aircraft rebounded noticeably in the fourth quarter, albeit to a level that was still far below the levels that prevailed before the downturn following the terrorist attacks in 2001. Both fleet sales of light vehicles and truck sales also rose significantly. In the high-tech sector, real outlays for computing equipment and for software again appeared to have posted sizable increases in the fourth quarter, while spending on communications equipment was little changed after three quarters of double-digit growth. Outside transportation and high tech, nominal shipments were about unchanged in the fourth quarter, but the upward trend in orders established since the beginning of last year was consistent with further gains in spending. After holding roughly steady, on balance, in the first half of 2003, real spending on private nonresidential construction appeared to have slipped further in the third and fourth quarters. In the commercial and health-care sector and in the manufacturing sector, average nominal outlays in October and November were about unchanged from the previous quarter. However, spending on other types of construction moved down.
