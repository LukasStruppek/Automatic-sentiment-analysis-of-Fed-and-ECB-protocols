Activity in the housing market remained very robust. In December, single-family starts edged down only a bit from the exceptional rate they had reached in November, and multifamily starts moved up to the highest level in almost four years. New home sales declined in November for the third consecutive month, but they were still not far below the record highs registered earlier in the year. Existing home sales had fallen back from September's high, though the level in November was still noticeably higher than average monthly sales in the first half of 2003.
