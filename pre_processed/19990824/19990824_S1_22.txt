The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in the second quarter, as the value of imports increased much more than that of exports. The rise in imports was spread widely across the major trade categories; sharply higher prices for imported oil, along with a moderate addition in the quantity imported, accounted for much of the rise, but there also were sizable step-ups in imports of computers, semiconductors, and industrial supplies--notably building materials. The increase in exports was concentrated in agricultural goods, automotive products, industrial supplies, computers, and semiconductors. Recent information suggested that economic recovery in Europe was continuing to gain momentum through the second quarter while the Japanese economy was showing some signs of having bottomed out over the first half of the year. Economic activity had remained on a strong upward trend in Canada in recent months, and economic growth picked up during the spring in the United Kingdom after having stagnated over the previous two quarters. The recent economic performance of the developing countries had been mixed. Most Asian economies grew robustly in the first half of the year, but economic activity in a number of Latin American economies, with the notable exceptions of Brazil and Mexico, remained weak.
