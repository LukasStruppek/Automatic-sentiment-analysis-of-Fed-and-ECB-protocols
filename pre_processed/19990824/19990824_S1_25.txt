Open market operations immediately after the meeting were directed toward implementing the desired, slightly greater pressure on reserve positions, and the federal funds rate averaged very close to the Committee's 5 percent target over the intermeeting period. Treasury coupon yields fell early in the intermeeting interval as market participants apparently adjusted downward their expectations regarding further monetary tightening in response to the generally unexpected move to a neutral directive and, subsequently, the receipt of favorable data on inflation. Yields later retraced their declines, however, in reaction to the semi-annual monetary policy report and the Chairman's associated testimony and to the release of data indicating an acceleration of labor costs, growing signs of a firming of activity abroad, and a weaker dollar. On net, most interest rates were about unchanged over the intermeeting interval. Key measures of share prices in equity markets, buoyed early in the period by lower interest rates and better-than-anticipated quarterly earnings reports, largely reversed those gains when rates backed up, and share prices ended the period with mixed results.
