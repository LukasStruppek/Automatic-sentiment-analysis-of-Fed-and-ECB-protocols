All the members who supported a tightening action also favored the retention of a symmetric directive. These members agreed that the Committee should keep its options open with regard to the next policy move, whose direction and timing would depend on evolving economic and financial conditions. In this regard, while agreeing that inflation risks had been substantially reduced by the actions taken in June and contemplated at today's meeting, many members continued to see a possible increase in inflation pressures as the main threat to sustained economic expansion. However, they did not anticipate that further tightening would be needed in the near term, allowing the Committee time to gather substantial additional information about the balance of aggregate supply and demand. The members all agreed that a symmetric directive would not preclude a tightening move if warranted by developments over the months ahead.
