The Committee's decision to authorize the use of reverse repurchase agreements until April 30 was intended to facilitate temporary reserve draining operations. These agreements are fundamentally equivalent to matched sale purchase transactions, which the Manager already has the authority to employ. However, the latter are not a common instrument in financial markets. Partly as a consequence, they lack the flexibility for use to drain reserves late during the business day, a flexibility that might be particularly desirable to have in place during the upcoming year-end period. Accordingly, the Committee voted unanimously to add reverse repurchase agreements to its "Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations," as shown in new paragraph 1(c) below.
