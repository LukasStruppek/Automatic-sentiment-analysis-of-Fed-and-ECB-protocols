Members agreed that there was some risk of unintended consequences in implementing these untried transactions. Nonetheless, the costs stemming from a dysfunctional financing market at year-end, in the unlikely event that it materializes, were immeasurably greater. The members did not question the desirability of addressing the latter risks and providing greater assurance that financing markets would retain sufficient depth and liquidity to permit market participants including the Federal Reserve to make necessary portfolio adjustments at year-end. Accordingly, the Committee voted unanimously to authorize the sale of options on temporary transactions for exercise though January 2000. This authority is indicated in the temporary addition of paragraph 4, shown below, to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations.
