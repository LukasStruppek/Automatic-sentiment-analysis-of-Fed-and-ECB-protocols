Industrial production recorded a large increase in July after having edged up in June. Part of the July advance reflected a surge in the output of electric utilities associated with the heat wave in the eastern United States and an upturn in mining production after a weak first half of the year. In manufacturing, production advanced briskly over the June-July period. While production of motor vehicles and aircraft fell on balance over the two months, output of high-tech products continued to expand at a rapid pace, and the manufacture of other goods rebounded strongly in July after declining a bit in June. Utilization of manufacturing capacity edged up in July but remained below its long-run average rate.
