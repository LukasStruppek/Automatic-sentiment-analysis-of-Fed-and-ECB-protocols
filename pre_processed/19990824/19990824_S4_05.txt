Chairman Greenspan announced the formation of a subcommittee to review the wording of the directive, its meaning, and what the Committee announces shortly after its meetings. He noted that the sentence relating to the symmetry of the directive was subject to differing interpretations, and the Committee's decision to announce immediately significant changes in the symmetry or asymmetry in the directive had made it desirable to clarify its meaning. Members also had expressed some discomfort with the way these announcements had been interpreted. While the Committee did not contemplate retreating from its policy of immediate announcements, it might want to examine whether some adjustment in its procedures would be helpful. The Chairman did not feel that the Committee was prepared to come to a decision on these issues before more experience was gained with the current announcement approach, but he believed it was advisable to form a subcommittee at this time to study the various questions that were involved. He anticipated that the subcommittee would come back to the Committee no later than next spring with recommendations or at least some alternatives for Committee consideration. He asked Mr. Ferguson to serve as its chairman and to select other members after consultation with his colleagues on the Committee.
