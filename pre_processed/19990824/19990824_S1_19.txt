Growth of consumer spending slowed appreciably in the second quarter after having surged earlier in the year; still, the underlying trend in spending remained relatively strong as a result of continuing robust expansion of disposable incomes and household wealth thus far this year and very positive consumer sentiment. Retail sales had increased moderately recently--a small decline in June was more than offset by a July rebound--while consumer outlays for services were buoyant in the second quarter (latest data). Housing activity remained strong in the June-July period; housing starts were only a little below the very high levels of earlier months of the year, and home sales remained at an elevated level in June (latest data).
