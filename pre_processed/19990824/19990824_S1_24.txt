At its meeting on June 29-30, 1999, the Committee adopted a directive that called for a slight tightening of conditions in reserve markets consistent with an increase of 0.25 percentage point in the federal funds rate to an average of around 5 percent. The members noted at that meeting that there were few current indications of rising inflation; nonetheless, with financial markets and foreign economies recovering since the Committee had eased policy last fall, the persisting strength of demand was enough to put added pressure over time on already very tight labor markets and at some point lead to a pickup in inflation that could threaten the sustainability of the economy's expansion. Because there was substantial uncertainty relating to the extent and timing of prospective inflationary pressures and thus the possibility that further firming of policy might not be needed in the very near term, the directive did not contain any bias relating to the direction of possible adjustments to policy in the intermeeting period.
