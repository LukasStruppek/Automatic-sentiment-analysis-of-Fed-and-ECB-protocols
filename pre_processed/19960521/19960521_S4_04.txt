[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that, on balance, economic activity has grown moderately in recent months. Nonfarm payroll employment changed little in April after rising substantially in the first quarter; the civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent. Industrial production increased sharply in April, largely reflecting a rebound in motor vehicle assemblies after a strike in March. Retail sales declined somewhat in April after posting a strong gain in the first quarter. Single-family housing starts rose considerably in April. Orders and contracts point to some deceleration in spending on business equipment and nonresidential structures after a very rapid expansion in the first quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened significantly in the first quarter from its rate in the fourth quarter of last year. Upward pressures on food and energy prices have led to somewhat larger increases in the consumer price index over recent months. ']
