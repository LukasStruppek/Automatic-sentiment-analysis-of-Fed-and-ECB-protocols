[' Nonfarm payroll employment was essentially unchanged in April after rising substantially in the first quarter; part of the slowdown resulted from an unwinding of special factors that had boosted job growth in the first quarter. Payrolls continued to expand in April in retail trade; finance, insurance, and real estate; and the services industries. In contrast, cmployment in construction fell sharply, reversing much of the large first-quarter gain. In manufacturing, employment declined further in April despite the settlement of a major strike in the automotive sector and the return of affected workers to their jobs. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent. ']
