[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had expanded moderately on balance in recent months. Final demand, which had been quite robust early in the year, was showing some signs of slowing in recent data. Consumer spending appeared to be growing at a moderate pace; business expenditures on durable equipment had registered further large gains, though new orders had flattened out; and housing demand seemed to be holding up well despite the increase in mortgage interest rates this year. Business inventories, most notably in the automotive industry, had been brought into better alignment with sales, and industrial production and employment had risen appreciably. Upward pressures on food and energy prices accounted for somewhat larger increases in consumer prices. ']
