In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to tighten reserve conditions by a slight amount consistent with an increase in the federal funds rate to a level of 6 percent. Persisting strength in aggregate domestic demand had been accommodated thus far without a pickup in underlying inflation because of the remarkable acceleration in productivity and because of two safety valves--the economy's ability to draw on the pool of available workers and to finance the rapid growth in imports relative to exports. However, a further acceleration in productivity was unlikely to boost the economy's growth potential sufficiently to satisfy the expansion in aggregate demand without some slowing in the latter. In addition, the two safety valves could not be counted on to work indefinitely. In these circumstances, the members saw substantial risks of rising pressures on labor and other resources and of higher inflation that called for some further firming of monetary policy at this meeting. They agreed, though, that because a significant acceleration in inflation did not appear to be imminent and because uncertainties continued to surround the economic outlook, a gradual approach to policy adjustments was warranted. Some members commented that, although a more forceful policy move of 50 basis points might be needed at some point, measured and predictable policy tightening moves, such as the one contemplated today, still were desirable in current circumstances, which included somewhat unsettled financial markets.
