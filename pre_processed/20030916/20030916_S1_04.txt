Private nonfarm payroll employment fell again in August, with a decline similar to those in June and July. Employment continued to fall in the manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, transportation and utilities, and information categories. Employment in the service industry was about unchanged as job losses in professional and business services largely offset expansion in non-business services. Growth in construction employment continued. Aggregate hours of private production workers edged down in August, reflecting the employment declines, while the average workweek was unchanged. The unemployment rate fell to 6.1 percent in August.
