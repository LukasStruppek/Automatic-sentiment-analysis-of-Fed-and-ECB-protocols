Retail sales rose a bit further in August after surging in July. Real personal consumption spending advanced briskly through July (latest data) as all major categories of outlays recorded increases. Real disposable income rose substantially in July largely because of the reduction in tax withholdings and the delivery of advance refund checks relating to higher childcare deductions. The further delivery of such checks in August was expected to have a positive effect on spending in that month as well. Although the index of consumer sentiment ticked down in August and early September, it remained well above its March low.
