Business outlays for equipment and software increased at a significant pace in the second quarter, and the available data pointed to a similar advance more recently. Spending was being supported by the continued gains in business output, low financing costs, ongoing price declines for high-tech capital, and the corporate sector's large cushion of liquid assets. Spending on transportation equipment and other capital goods was brisk in the second quarter, although expenditures in the high-tech sector decelerated. In July, shipments of capital goods excluding aircraft fell substantially from the rate seen in the first half of the year, but orders were relatively strong. Real business investment in nonresidential structures remained depressed, but the most recent data provided a sign of some improvement. In the office sector, the vacancy rate came in only a little below its recent peak, although property values had inched up, and the vacancy rate for industrial space also remained near its high. The retail sector, in contrast, continued to fare better.
