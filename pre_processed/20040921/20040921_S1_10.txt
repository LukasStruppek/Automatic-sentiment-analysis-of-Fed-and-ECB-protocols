The U.S. international trade deficit reached a record high in June, bringing it to a new high in the second quarter as a percentage of nominal GDP. While the deficit fell back in July, it remained much above May's reading. In June, exports fell sharply, with declines widespread, while imports rose, owing in part to a surge in petroleum imports. In July, exports registered a modest recovery, driven by capital goods, industrial supplies, and automotive products, while the value of imports fell with the sharp decline in oil imports. Economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to expand in the second quarter, although growth slowed in Japan and in the euro area. Indicators to date for the third quarter were mixed.
