Excluding motor vehicles, the pace of inventory accumulation in July continued at its second-quarter rate. A decline in stocks in the retail trade segment was more than offset by stockbuilding in the manufacturing and wholesale trade segments. Although the book value of manufacturing and trade inventories rose appreciably in July, these gains were again inflated by price increases in the petroleum sector. Inventory-sales ratios in the manufacturing sector, as in the retail and wholesale trade sectors (excluding motor vehicles and parts), remained about flat in July.
