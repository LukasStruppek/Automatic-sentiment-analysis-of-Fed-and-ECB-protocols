The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth regained some vigor in recent months after having slowed in late spring. The August labor market report showed a moderate gain in payrolls. After contracting in June, industrial production strengthened modestly on average in July and August, and the increases were widespread across sectors. Consumer spending rose sharply in July, housing activity increased further in August, and business outlays picked up last month. Core consumer price inflation moderated in June and July, and a decline in energy prices further damped overall inflation in July.
