Real consumer spending grew sharply in July after having slowed in the second quarter, and the available indicators suggest that spending held fairly steady in August. Expenditures on goods jumped in July and moderated in August, while spending on services moved up somewhat in July. Purchases of motor vehicles surged in July and fell back in August. For the two months together, the average pace of these outlays exceeded that seen in the first half of the year, reflecting in part a further sweetening of incentives. Real disposable income was up slightly in July, as increases in compensation were largely offset by declines in other income categories. The latest readings on consumer confidence showed a drop in August amid labor market slack and near-record gasoline prices, and a further slight decline in September, but the readings for the third quarter averaged above those for the second quarter.
