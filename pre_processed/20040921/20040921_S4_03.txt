With regard to the Committee's announcement to be released after the meeting, the members agreed that the statement should indicate that, after moderating earlier in the year, partly in response to the substantial rise in energy prices, output growth appeared to have regained some traction and that labor market conditions had improved modestly. In addition, policymakers concurred that the statement should indicate that inflation and inflation expectations had eased in recent months. They also agreed again to characterize the risks to sustainable growth and price stability as balanced. Members commented that recent evidence had boosted their confidence that moderate economic growth would continue and that inflation would be contained. With aggregate demand probably expanding at least as rapidly as the economy's potential to produce over the next several quarters, policymakers continued to see economic conditions as likely to warrant a further reduction in policy accommodation in coming quarters. However, in the view of many members, policy actions would need to be increasingly keyed to incoming data. Indeed, it was noted that market participants now appeared to anticipate some slowing in the pace of policy firming before long and did not interpret the removal of policy accommodation at a measured rate as necessarily involving the same policy action at each meeting.
