Investors had largely anticipated the FOMC's decision at its August meeting to maintain the federal funds rate at its current level, and short-term rates dropped only a bit in response. Subsequently, data on inflation that were weaker than expected, substantial declines in oil prices, and the release of the minutes of the August FOMC meeting led investors to revise down their expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate. Over the intermeeting period, yields on short- and intermediate-term nominal Treasury securities fell, while yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities of comparable maturity increased somewhat, pushing inflation compensation considerably lower at those horizons. Nominal forward rates further out the yield curve fell about the same amount as real forward rates, implying little change in far-forward inflation compensation. Spreads of yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds over those on Treasury securities were about unchanged. Major stock price indexes posted solid gains. The foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies was little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period.
