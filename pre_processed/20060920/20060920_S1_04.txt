Industrial production rose in July but edged down in August. Manufacturing output was unchanged in August, as a small increase in the production of motor vehicles and parts was offset by a slight net decline in other sectors. Output of construction supplies, for example, dropped a little. In the high-technology sector, the production of computers rose tepidly through the summer, while output of communications equipment turned down in August after increasing markedly during the first half of the year. Semiconductor production remained sluggish through August.
