Both imports and exports increased in the second quarter, but imports increased and exports decreased in July, widening the U.S. trade deficit. The growth of imports was heavily concentrated in oil, reflecting higher petroleum prices, and in non-oil industrial supplies and capital goods. Imports of services fell slightly. Exports of capital goods and industrial supplies declined after considerable gains in June, but exports of telecommunications equipment and automotive products were strong. Exports of services were unchanged in July.
