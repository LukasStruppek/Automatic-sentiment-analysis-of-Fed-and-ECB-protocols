Consumer spending appeared to be rising at a moderate pace in recent months. Spending on cars and light trucks increased somewhat in July after a lackluster pace in the second quarter but apparently weakened in August. Consumer spending on goods excluding motor vehicles increased modestly during the four months ending in July. Despite the sharp net increase in energy prices, real disposable income rose further, with solid gains in June and July. Increases in household wealth earlier in the year continued to boost consumer spending. However, consumer borrowing costs had risen since the beginning of the year with the increase in short-term interest rates. Recent readings on consumer sentiment were mixed. The personal saving rate fell further in July.
