Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors in the third quarter was estimated to be rising at about the same pace as in second quarter. Business-sector debt was increasing briskly, as the expansion of business loans remained robust. In the household sector, debt expanded in the second quarter at a rate slightly below that in the first quarter, as mortgage debt decelerated somewhat. M2 growth remained modest in August, consistent with moderating growth of nominal income and lagged increases in opportunity cost.
