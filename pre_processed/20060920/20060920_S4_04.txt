Mr. Lacker dissented because he believed that further tightening was needed to bring inflation down more rapidly than would be the case if the policy rate were kept unchanged. Recent data indicated that inflation remained above levels consistent with price stability. Moreover, the upswing in compensation and unit labor costs in the first half of the year indicated that inflation risks were tilted to the upside. Although real growth was likely to be moderate in coming quarters, in his view it was unlikely to be slow enough to bring core inflation down.
