After strong increases in the first half of 2006, real spending on equipment and software remained robust into the summer against a backdrop of rising business output, plentiful corporate cash reserves, positive sentiment among executives, and falling relative prices for high-tech equipment. Orders and shipments of communications equipment leveled off in recent months after climbing earlier this year. Real computer spending remained sluggish in July. Business purchases of light vehicles picked up in August after a weak performance in July, and sales of medium and heavy trucks remained brisk. Available data indicated that aircraft purchases remained flat. Real spending on equipment outside the high-tech and transportation sectors appeared to be increasing moderately in the current quarter.
