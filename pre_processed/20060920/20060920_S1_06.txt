Residential construction activity continued to contract in recent months. Single-family starts fell further in July and August to a level well below the peak in the third quarter of 2005. Construction in the multifamily sector also fell back. Sales of both new and existing single-family homes fell in July and were significantly below the peaks of last summer. A range of indicators suggested that housing market activity was likely to slow further in the near term. Pending home sales dropped noticeably in July, and mortgage rates had increased since the beginning of the year. Available measures suggested that prices of existing homes increased through the second quarter at a much lower rate than the one observed during the same period last year.
