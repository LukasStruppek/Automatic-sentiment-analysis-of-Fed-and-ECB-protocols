[' In their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members saw widespread evidence of a well established expansion. Some signs of moderation from the rapid advance in recent quarters had emerged, including statistical and anecdotal indications of somewhat slower growth of consumer spending. Members noted, however, that an apparently significant portion of the recent weakness in sales of motor vehicles appeared to be related to supply shortages that were in the process of being corrected. Consumer confidence remained at a high level and likely reflected, among other factors, the strength in job markets in many parts of the country. Nonetheless, more moderate consumer spending was a reasonable expectation in the context of a low saving rate, increased consumer debt levels, and higher interest rates. One member commented that some pause in the expansion of overall consumer spending would not be unusual after several quarters of robust growth, and another remarked that the rise in household expenditures had been larger than the increase in household cash incomes by an appreciable margin over the past year.
