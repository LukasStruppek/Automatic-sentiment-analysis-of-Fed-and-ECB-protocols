[' Both M2 and M3 expanded in July after declining on average over May and June. The growth of M2 in July owed in part to a sizable increase in liquid deposits, but in light of a resumption of run-offs at bond mutual funds it also may have reflected a renewed preference by households for the protection of principal provided by money market mutual funds. The strength in M2 showed through to M3, which also was boosted by funds garnered from wholesale sources to finance a surge in bank credit. For the year through July, M2 and M3 grew at rates slightly above the bottom of their ranges for 1994. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a moderate pace. ']
