[' Industrial production rose moderately in July after a sizable gain in June; a decline in electricity generation from its unusually high weather-related level in June damped the July advance. Manufacturing output was up considerably in July, despite a drop in the production of motor vehicles and parts; outside of motor vehicles, increases were widespread, with a very large rise recorded in the output of durable consumer goods. The overall rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing remained at a high level, with most major industry groups operating at or near capacity. ']
