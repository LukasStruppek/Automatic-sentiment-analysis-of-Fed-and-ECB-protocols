[' Members focused on recent inventory developments, which in the context of some moderation in the growth of final demand had accounted for a considerable portion of the overall expansion in GDP reported for the second quarter. While the rate of inventory accumulation could be expected to slow in the current quarter, the extent of that slowing and its retarding effects on near-term economic growth were uncertain. Partly on the basis of anecdotal reports, the members concluded that much of the inventory buildup in the second quarter was voluntary, thereby reducing the probability of a sharp reversal. Indeed, to the degree that delivery lead times might edge up in various industries as capacity constraints were encountered, stronger efforts to build inventories could emerge, especially against the background of currently low inventory-to-sales ratios. Some business contacts reported that they were planning to add to their inventories over the months ahead. At the same time, ongoing business efforts to maintain relatively lean inventories undoubtedly would tend to limit any broad buildup in inventories. ']
