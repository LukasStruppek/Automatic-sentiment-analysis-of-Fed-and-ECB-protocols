[' Trends in broad measures of prices and labor costs had shown no change thus far in 1994. In July, the overall index of consumer prices rose at the same pace as in June, despite larger monthly increases in the food and energy components of the index. The jump in energy prices reflected the effects of the earlier run-up in crude oil prices. For the twelve months ended in July, both the overall index and the index excluding food and energy rose by about the same amounts as during the preceding twelve-month period. At the producer level, prices of finished goods were up significantly in July after no change in June; large price increases were recorded for coffee and finished energy goods. Prices of finished goods other than food and energy were unchanged on balance over June and July and registered only a small rise over the twelve months ended in July. At an earlier stage of processing, producer prices of intermediate materials posted another sizable gain in July. These prices had increased at a faster rate thus far this year than in 1993, mirroring a similar pattern in prices of nonfood, non-energy crude materials. The employment cost index for private industry workers rose more rapidly in the second quarter after a sharp slowing in the first quarter, with the acceleration in compensation largely reflecting a pickup in wage and salary growth. The increase in total compensation over the last four quarters was little changed from the advance over the previous four-quarter period. ']
