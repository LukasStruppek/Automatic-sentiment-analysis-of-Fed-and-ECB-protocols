[' Business fixed investment expanded in the second quarter at about the same brisk pace as in the first quarter but well below the rate recorded in 1993. In the second quarter, a strong recovery in nonresidential construction activity from the weather-related decline of the first quarter offset a marked slowing in business purchases of durable equipment. Much of the slowdown in the growth of outlays for equipment reflected a reduction in the pace of acquisition of office and computing equipment. Other categories of durable equipment, with the exception of aircraft and motor vehicles, continued to show solid increases. Most indicators of business investment activity suggested further large gains in coming months: Orders for nondefense capital goods pointed to a continued strong expansion in spending on business equipment, and permits for nonresidential construction had been rising as well.
