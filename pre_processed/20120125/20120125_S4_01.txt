 Members viewed the information on US economic activity received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that the economy had been expanding moderately and generally agreed that the economic outlook had not changed greatly since they met in December While overall labor market conditions had improved somewhat further and unemployment had declined in recent months, almost all members viewed the unemployment rate as still elevated relative to levels that they saw as consistent with the Committee's mandate over the longer run Available data indicated some slowing in the pace of economic growth in Europe and in some emerging market economies, pointing to reduced growth of US exports going forward With the economy facing continuing headwinds from the recent financial crisis and with growth slowing in a number of US export markets, members generally expected a modest pace of economic growth over coming quarters, with the unemployment rate declining only gradually Strains in global financial markets continued to pose significant downside risks to economic activity Inflation had been subdued in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations remained stable Members generally anticipated that inflation over coming quarters would run at or below the 2 percent level that the Committee judges most consistent with its mandate
