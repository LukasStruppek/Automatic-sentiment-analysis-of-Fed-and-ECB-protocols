In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4-1/4 percent. With spending apparently retaining considerable momentum, and with the indirect effects of increased energy prices still threatening to raise core inflation at least for a time, the Committee thought that additional policy firming at this meeting was appropriate to keep inflation and inflation expectations in check. Committee members generally anticipated that policy would likely need to be firmed further going forward. In that process, the Committee would need to be mindful of the lags in the effect of policy firming on the economy. However, it would also have to take account of the effects of the sustained period of favorable financial conditions on asset prices and aggregate demand as well as the resulting possibility of further increases in resource utilization and pressures on prices. Views differed on how much further tightening might be required. Because the Committee's actions over the past eighteen months had significantly reduced the degree of monetary policy accommodation, members thought that the policy outlook was becoming considerably less certain and that policy decisions going forward would depend to an increased extent on the implications of incoming economic data for future growth and inflation.
