The expansion of domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have moderated a little from its brisk third-quarter pace. Consumer credit dipped in October, and nonfinancial firms' net borrowing in the form of bank loans, commercial paper, and bonds was a bit below the third-quarter pace. Household bankruptcies hovered at very low levels in recent weeks after soaring to unprecedented heights just before the implementation of more-stringent bankruptcy rules in mid-October. Hurricane relief payments apparently boosted M2 in October, but that aggregate decelerated in November, partly reflecting the continued rise in the opportunity cost of holding liquid deposits.
