Real outlays for equipment and software posted a solid gain in the third quarter. Although business purchases of motor vehicles declined in October and November, growth in investment in nontransportation equipment appeared to have been well maintained in the fourth quarter. Rising business sales, a declining cost of capital, and ample financial resources in the corporate sector continued to foster a favorable environment for capital spending, a sentiment echoed in executive surveys, which generally pointed to widespread increases in planned capital outlays. Real spending on nonresidential construction improved materially in the third quarter, boosted by substantial gains in drilling and mining expenditures.
