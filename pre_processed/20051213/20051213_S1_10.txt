Core consumer price inflation was moderate in recent months, although some signs of pass-through of higher energy costs were evident, especially in transportation services. Consumer energy prices had retreated notably from their elevated post-hurricane levels. Wholesale and retail gasoline prices dropped as gasoline inventories rebounded. And spot prices for natural gas fell sharply through mid-November amidst unusually temperate weather, plentiful inventories, and declining prices of competing fuels; unusually cold weather in early December, however, caused spot prices to move back up to their October levels. Presumably in response to falling retail energy prices, one survey of households in November and early December showed a marked retreat in expectations for inflation over the coming year. Longer-term inflation expectations also edged down, but stayed a touch above the narrow range observed in recent years. Although recent increases in energy costs had pushed up producer prices in some sectors, overall producer price inflation remained subdued. With regard to labor costs, the twelve-month change in the employment cost index for private industry workers in September was well below its year-ago increase. Hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector also appeared to have slowed a bit recently.
