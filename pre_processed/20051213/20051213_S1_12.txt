Market participants widely anticipated the Committee's decision at its November meeting, and the policy announcement evoked little reaction in financial markets. Over the intermeeting period, investors marked up slightly their expectations for the path of monetary policy in light of stronger-than-expected data on spending and production. Nominal Treasury yields changed little, on net, but measures of inflation compensation at longer horizons--which are calculated using yields on nominal and inflation-protected securities--declined somewhat. Credit spreads on both investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds were about unchanged over the intermeeting period. Major equity price indexes posted substantial gains, spurred by the perception that the economy had retained considerable momentum with limited inflation pressures. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar was about unchanged over the intermeeting period.
