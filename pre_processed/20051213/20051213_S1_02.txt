The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy continued to expand at a solid rate in the fourth quarter. Industrial production rebounded, and employment growth appeared to have recovered smartly from the depressing effects of recent hurricanes. Although some scattered signs of cooling of the housing sector had emerged, the pace of construction activity and sales remained brisk. More broadly, spending by consumers and businesses was well maintained. Core consumer price inflation remained subdued, even though some of the increase in energy costs had apparently passed through to prices of final goods and services.
