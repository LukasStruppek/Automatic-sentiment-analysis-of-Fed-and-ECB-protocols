For many, heightened economic uncertainty in the current environment implied greater uncertainty about the range of possible policy outcomes and placed a premium on flexibility in setting policy at upcoming meetings. Some members commented that this greater uncertainty called for eliminating or paring back forward-looking language from the statement--if not at this meeting, then fairly soon. In the event, most members viewed the forward-looking language in the statement--including the characterization of the stance of policy as accommodative as well as the judgment that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that is "likely to be measured"--as a reasonable characterization of the policy stance and its likely evolution over time. Moreover, a number remarked that the language in its current form was clearly conditioned on economic developments and therefore would not stand in the way of either a pause or a step-up in policy firming depending on events. In the end, all members agreed to retain the forward-looking language.
