U.S. consumer price inflation firmed in recent months as energy prices rose sharply. Core consumer prices also rose a bit more rapidly recently, but the increase over the twelve months ending in March was little different than over the year-earlier period. According to survey information, expectations of near-term inflation picked up in March, consistent with the increase in energy prices. As for labor costs, the employment cost index for private industry decelerated over the first quarter from an already moderate pace. The slowing occurred in both the wages and salaries component and the benefits component and was fairly widespread across industry groups.
