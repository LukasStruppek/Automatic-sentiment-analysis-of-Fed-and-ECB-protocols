[' The prospects for inventory investment remained a key uncertainty in the outlook in that developments in this sector could well have an important bearing on the extent of the anticipated slowing in the expansion of overall economic activity over the next few quarters. The surge in inventory investment in the second quarter clearly was unsustainable, but some members questioned whether the expected cutback in inventory accumulation would be sizable over the near term. Continuing strength in new orders and anecdotal reports did not point to a desire to reduce inventories and suggested that much of the second-quarter buildup probably had been intended. Indeed, in the context of increasing backlogs and lagging deliveries that pointed to growing capacity constraints, many business firms might seek to build "safety stocks" to avoid supply disruptions that would interfere with production schedules. At the same time, the trend toward "just in time" inventory management--even if temporarily arrested as safety stocks were increased--would help to limit a potentially excessive buildup in inventories that would present a threat later to the sustainability of the expansion.
