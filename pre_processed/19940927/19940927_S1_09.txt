[' The growth in business inventories slowed markedly in July after surging in the second quarter. The July deceleration reflected a sizable reduction in retail inventories, principally automotive and general merchandise stocks. For the retail sector as a whole, the inventory-to-sales ratio declined sharply in July to about the middle of the range seen in recent years. At the wholesale level, inventories increased substantially, both in July and over the second quarter, and the overall inventory-to-sales ratio edged up in July toward the middle of the range for this ratio in recent years. Inventory investment also picked up in manufacturing, where much of the July accumulation represented stocks of materials, supplies, and work-in-progress. The run-up in stocks was accompanied by a drop in factory shipments, and as a result, the inventory-shipments ratio recorded an unusually steep rise. ']
