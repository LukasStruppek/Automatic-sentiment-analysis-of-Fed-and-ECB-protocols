[" Mr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that a prompt move to somewhat greater monetary restraint was needed at this point. In his view, the current stance of monetary policy was overly accommodative in light of the signs of increasing price pressures and rising inflationary expectations that were associated with the continuing strength of the economic expansion and high levels of capacity utilization. In this situation, a delay in implementing some monetary policy tightening would incur a substantial risk of a further increase in inflationary expectations and could make it more costly to achieve the Committee's longer-term anti-inflationary goals.
