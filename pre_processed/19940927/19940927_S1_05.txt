[" Nonfarm payroll employment advanced appreciably further in August, though at a somewhat less rapid rate than the average pace in earlier months of the year. The slowdown in hiring in August was concentrated in retail trade, where employment was little changed after large gains in the two prior months, and in construction, where it fell slightly. In manufacturing, employment was up considerably after essentially no change in July; while much of the strength was related to a pickup in the production of motor vehicles, hiring was up in a number of other industries as well. The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers declined in August from July's relatively high level, but for the two months combined the average hours worked was well above the second-quarter level. Both household employment and the labor force surged in August, and the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.1 percent. "]
