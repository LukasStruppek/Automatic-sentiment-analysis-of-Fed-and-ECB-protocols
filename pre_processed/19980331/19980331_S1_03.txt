[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy continued to expand rapidly during the early months of 1998. Apparently, strong growth in private domestic spending for consump- tion, housing, and business equipment more than offset weakness in net exports and a slight moderation in inventory investment. Total employment continued to rise rapidly, but industrial production increased at a considerably slower pace. Despite indications of persisting pressures on employment costs associated with tight labor markets, price inflation abated further, primarily as a consequence of large declines in energy prices. ']
