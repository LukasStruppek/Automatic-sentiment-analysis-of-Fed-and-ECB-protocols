[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity continued to grow rapidly during the early months of 1998. Nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply further in January and February, and the civilian unemployment rate, at 4.6 percent in February, equaled its low for the current economic expansion. However, growth in manufacturing payroll employment was down over the first two months of the year, and factory output decelerated appreciably. Consumer spending has risen considerably further since year-end, and housing activity also has strengthened in recent months. Available indicators point to a sharp rebound in business fixed investment following a small decline in the fourth quarter. Fragmentary data on nonfarm inventories suggest a slower rate of accumulation early in the year. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in January from its average monthly rate in the fourth quarter. Despite indications of persisting pressures on employment costs associated with tight labor markets, price inflation has abated further, primarily as a consequence of large declines in energy prices.
