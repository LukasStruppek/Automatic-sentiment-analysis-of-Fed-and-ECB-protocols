Yields on investment-grade bonds generally moved in tandem with those on Treasuries over the intermeeting period, but spreads on high-yield bonds widened as investors reassessed credit risks in light of the negative tone of some incoming economic data. The disappointing employment data and renewed concerns about terrorism contributed to a decline in broad equity price indexes. Technology-related issues, which had registered very large gains over the preceding year or so, fell more sharply. The foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies declined through the middle of February but subsequently rebounded to end the intermeeting period higher.
