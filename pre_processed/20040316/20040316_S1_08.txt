Spending on capital goods had advanced at a vigorous pace in the fourth quarter and appeared to be continuing that growth early this year. Spending by businesses was supported by increases in their sales and the continuation of strong cash flows and a low user cost of capital. Nominal shipments of computing and communication equipment moved up sharply in recent months, as did shipments outside the high-tech sector. By contrast, business investment in transportation equipment was mixed. Data for new orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft suggested that the strength in capital expenditures would continue going forward. As has been the case for some time, real spending on private nonresidential structures languished, and vacancies in industrial buildings and office properties were at high levels.
