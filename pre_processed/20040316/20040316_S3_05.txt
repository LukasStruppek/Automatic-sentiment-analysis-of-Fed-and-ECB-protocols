Consumer spending outside the auto sector had remained strong, with data and retail contacts generally suggesting continued growth in sales this year. Committee members noted that sales had been bolstered by rising asset prices and the effects of last year's tax cuts on refunds and final payments. By contrast, sales of motor vehicles had fallen back noticeably, reflecting in part reductions in incentives. However, members anticipated that sales would pick up again, partly in response to an anticipated rebound in incentives. Looking forward, gains in employment and the pass-through of higher productivity to wages and salaries were also expected to boost consumer spending, even as the stimulus to growth from tax cuts faded and increases in home and equity prices likely slowed from their rapid pace in recent quarters.
