The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that economic activity would continue to expand at a solid pace through 2005. Monetary policy is expected to support growth over the projection period, and fiscal policy is anticipated to remain accommodative through 2004. In addition, structural productivity growth is projected to remain substantial this year and next. Strong advances in real disposable income were expected to keep consumer spending on a solid upward trajectory. Business spending on equipment and software was seen as increasing briskly as a result of sizable profits, an improving outlook for demand, and continued favorable financing conditions. Also, inventory investment was anticipated to rise gradually as businesses became more convinced that final demand was expanding along a sustainable track. The pace of economic expansion was forecasted to be sufficient to reduce resource slack over this year and next, although the employment data received over the intermeeting period indicated that this process would begin from a higher rate of unused resources than had been previously expected. Core inflation was projected to remain low over the forecast period.
