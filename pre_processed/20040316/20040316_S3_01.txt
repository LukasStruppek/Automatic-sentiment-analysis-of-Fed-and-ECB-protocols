In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, the members noted that overall economic activity still seemed to be increasing at a solid pace, though perhaps not quite as quickly as some members had anticipated at the time of the January meeting. Investment spending had continued to advance, and the manufacturing sector, which had lagged the rest of the economy earlier in the expansion, had extended recent gains. Residential construction activity was down somewhat from the very high levels posted late last year, but increases in household wealth and the effects of last year's tax cuts continued to buoy consumer spending. Despite the gains in spending and production, however, employment growth had been disappointing. While job losses had moderated, hiring had yet to strengthen, holding down net increases in employment. Nonetheless, the breadth of the expansion was seen as providing considerable assurance of its sustainability, and Committee members generally expected that accommodative monetary policy, favorable financial market conditions, and, at least in the near term, fiscal stimulus would continue to foster a pace of output growth that exceeded that of its potential. Although economic slack likely would be declining, it was expected to be a little higher than previously had been anticipated. Prices for energy, commodities, and non-oil imports were rising, however, and some business contacts had reported seeing a return of "pricing power." On balance, inflation was expected to remain near its current low level.
