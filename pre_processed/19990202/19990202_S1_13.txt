At its meeting on December 22, 1998, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 4-3/4 percent and that did not contain any bias with regard to the direction of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. In the Committee's view, the stance of policy appeared to be consistent with its objectives of fostering sustained low inflation and high employment, and the risks to this outlook were reasonably well balanced over the near term.
