The pace of business inventory investment in October and November was slightly above that of the third quarter, but in comparison with strong sales inventory positions were relatively lean in most industries. In manufacturing, stocks increased moderately in the October-November period, and the aggregate stock-shipments ratio was in the middle of its narrow range for the past year. Inventory investment in the wholesale sector slowed considerably, but much of the swing reflected the unusually early harvest of farm products. The inventory-sales ratio for this sector was still at the top of its range for the last year, and inventory overhangs persisted in metals and minerals, machinery, and chemicals. Retailers stepped up their inventory accumulation in the October-November period. However, sales were robust and the inventory-sales ratio for this sector continued to trend downward.
