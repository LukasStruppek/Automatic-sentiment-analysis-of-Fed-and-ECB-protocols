M2 and M3 continued to expand rapidly in December, with their liquid components, especially money market funds, registering particularly large increases. The effects of recent monetary policy easings in reducing the opportunity costs of these components, strong growth in GDP, and perhaps continued heightened demands for liquid and safe assets seemed to have contributed to this performance. Available data for January pointed to appreciable moderation in the growth of both aggregates. From the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998, M2 and M3 rose at rates well above their annual ranges, while total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a pace somewhat above the middle of its range.
