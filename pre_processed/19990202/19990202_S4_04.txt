The Committee discussed the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 which provides for the termination of the legal requirements for semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins reports to Congress after 1999. At this meeting, the members agreed that the semi-annual reports and associated Congressional hearings had been quite useful and should be continued. They had given the Committee an effective means to explain its policies and communicate its views on a variety of issues and had enhanced its accountability to the public and the Congress.
