Business fixed investment picked up markedly in the fourth quarter after the small decline of the previous quarter. Much of the surge in spending on producers' durable equipment was attributable to a pickup in purchases of motor vehicles and aircraft. Elsewhere, investment in high-tech equipment expanded rapidly further, while spending for other types of durable equipment decelerated somewhat. Nonresidential construction activity apparently rose moderately in the fourth quarter. Office construction picked up further in an environment of falling vacancy rates and rising rental costs, but other building activity remained sluggish.
