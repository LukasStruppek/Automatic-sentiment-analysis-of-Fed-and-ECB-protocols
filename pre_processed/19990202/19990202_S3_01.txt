In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members referred to continuing indications of an exceptional economic performance that was characterized by the persistence of quite low inflation despite very high and rapidly rising levels of overall output and employment. The members currently saw few signs that the economic expansion had moderated to a more sustainable rate, but most continued to anticipate substantial slowing over the year ahead to a pace close to or somewhat above that of the economy's long-run potential. While many agreed that such an outlook was subject to greater upside risk than they had anticipated a few months ago--given the abatement of market turmoil and positive business and consumer sentiment---such factors as the waning effects of the earlier increases in stock market wealth on consumer spending and some slowing in the extraordinary growth in business expenditures for equipment were likely to exert a moderating effect on the expansion. Moreover, potentially greater weakness in foreign economies and possible disruption to foreign financial markets remained a downside risk to the outlook. Against this background, the members generally anticipated some pickup in inflation, though to a still relatively low rate, primarily as last year's declines in oil and other import prices were not repeated. A number referred, however, to the experience of recent years, which suggested that the inflation process was not well understood and that inflation forecasts were subject to a wide range of uncertainty.
