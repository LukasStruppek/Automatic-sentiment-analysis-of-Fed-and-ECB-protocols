Robust domestic demand clearly had offset weakness in net exports by a large margin in 1998, and while the growth in such demand was projected to slow this year it was expected to remain sufficient to support appreciable further expansion in overall economic activity. Consumer spending had exhibited considerable vigor during the recent holiday season and anecdotal reports from several regions suggested that the momentum in such spending had carried into the opening weeks of this year. Further, though prospectively moderating, growth in jobs and incomes, supportive credit conditions, and upbeat consumer sentiment suggested that consumer expenditures were likely to be well maintained over coming quarters. Even so, members anticipated at least some moderation in the growth of consumption after an extended period of sizable accumulation of consumer durable goods. Among other factors, the positive effects on consumer spending of the large accumulation of stock market wealth in recent years were likely to abate over time in the absence of a further and unanticipated surge in stock market prices.
