In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members favored an unchanged policy stance. Many were concerned that the odds were tilted toward rising inflation over time, especially if the expansion did not slow to a more sustainable rate. Members commented that the market unsettlement that had in large measure prompted the Committee's easing actions during the fall had now lessened appreciably. In the view of some, those actions might need to be reversed, at least in part, to restore what they regarded as a policy stance that seemed most likely to prove consistent with desirable economic trends. Still, the persistence of subdued inflation and the absence of current evidence of accelerating inflation were seen as arguing against a policy tightening move at this point. Moreover, it was clear that the outlook for economic activity was subject to considerable uncertainty and that some shortfall from current forecasts, perhaps in conjunction with unexpectedly adverse trade and financial influences stemming from developments abroad, might materialize and damp inflationary demand pressures. Even in the absence of greater-than-anticipated slowing in the economic expansion, the experience of recent years had amply demonstrated that the relationship between demand pressures on resources and inflation was not following historical patterns, and developments exerting a more lasting moderating effect on inflation, such as more productive capital investment and effective access to spare capacity overseas, could help to contain inflation for some time. Against this background, the members agreed on the need to continue to monitor the economy with care for signs either of a potential upturn in inflation or greater softness in the expansion than they were currently forecasting and to be prepared to respond promptly in either direction.
