Industrial production rebounded in December from a small November decline. Industrial output strengthened for the fourth quarter as a whole, largely reflecting a surge in the production of motor vehicles and parts that more than offset sizable reductions in mining and utility output. The manufacture of high-tech equipment surged further and the production of construction supplies stayed on a brisk upward trend while activity in other manufacturing categories remained weak. On balance, output in manufacturing expanded at about the same pace as capacity, leaving the factory operating rate unchanged at a relatively low level.
