The information reviewed at this meeting suggests some pickup in the expansion of economic activity from the sluggish rate in the fourth quarter. Total non farm payroll employment increased sharply in January and February after growing at a reduced pace on average in previous months; a surge in the service producing sector and a weather-related rebound in construction were only partly offset by a net decline in manufacturing. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 5.3 percent. In February, production in the manufacturing sector retraced its large January decline, reflecting a swing in the production of motor vehicles. Consumer spending has been affected in recent months by fluctuations in expenditures for motor vehicles and energy-related items but on balance has expanded at a relatively slow pace; outlays for goods have been weak while expenditures for services have remained strong. Unusually mild weather con tributed to a higher level of housing starts in January and February. Business capital spending, adjusted for inflation, appears to have turned up after a decline in the fourth quarter, reflecting a pickup in expenditures on motor vehicles and aircraft. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened in January from its low December rate but remained at roughly its fourth-quarter average. Consumer prices rose more rapidly over January and February, only partly as a result of increases in prices of food and energy. Most short- and intermediate-term interest rates have risen a little since the Committee meeting on February 6-7; rates in long-term debt markets show mixed changes over the period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose over the intermeeting period; much of the appreciation of the dollar was against the yen.
