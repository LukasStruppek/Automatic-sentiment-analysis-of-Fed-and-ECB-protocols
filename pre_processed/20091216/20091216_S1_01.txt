 The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets since the Committee's November 3-4 meeting Financial conditions generally had become somewhat more supportive of economic growth There was little evidence of year-end funding pressures, although demand for Treasury bills with maturities extending just beyond year-end remained elevated The Manager also reported on System open market operations in agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) during the intermeeting period The Desk continued to gradually slow the pace of purchases of these securities in accordance with the program for asset purchases that the Committee announced at the end of its November meeting By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified those transactions There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period Since the Committee met in November, the Federal Reserve's total assets were about unchanged, at nearly $22 trillion, as the increase in the System's holdings of securities roughly matched a further decline in usage of the System's credit and liquidity facilities The Manager noted that the System's holdings of securities will tend to decline gradually after the completion of the asset purchase programs, reflecting maturing issues and prepayments on holdings of MBS The Manager noted that the Committee would likely wish to discuss in detail its policy for reinvesting the proceeds of maturing issues and prepayments; he proposed, as an interim approach, continuing the practice of not reinvesting the proceeds of maturing agency securities or MBS prepayments Meeting participants supported that interim approach pending further discussion at future meetings
