 Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that growth in economic activity slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions Labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement The unemployment rate, however, remained elevated when judged against members' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment Household spending and business fixed investment continued to advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint had diminished The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, the economy would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with the dual mandate Moreover, members judged that the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market were nearly balanced Inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective, and this was seen as posing possible risks to economic performance, but members anticipated that stable inflation expectations and strengthening economic activity would, over time, return inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective However, in light of their concerns about the possible persistence of low inflation, members agreed that inflation developments should be monitored carefully for evidence that inflation was moving back toward the Committee's longer-run objective
