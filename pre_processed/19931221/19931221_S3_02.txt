[' In their comments about developments across the nation, members observed that economic conditions clearly had strengthened in many regions and that the better conditions had fostered appreciable improvement in business and consumer sentiment in most parts of the country. The members recognized that the economic expansion was still quite subdued in many local areas and that economic activity remained depressed in some parts of the country such as southern California. The overall strength of the economy was fueled to an important extent by interest-sensitive spending on producer and consumer durables and housing and tended to confirm the durability of the expansion. Gains in such spending were not likely to be sustained at their recent rates, but the cash flow and income that such expenditures had generated were likely to foster further economic growth, especially in the context of generally supportive conditions in financial and credit markets. The members acknowledged that a number of factors continued to constrain the expansion, including ongoing though less pervasive balance-sheet rebuilding, business restructuring and downsizing activities, and the downtrend in defense spending. On balance, however, current developments did not point to a marked deviation from the moderate growth trend in economic activity that had been experienced over the past two years, though in the view of a number of members the odds on somewhat stronger growth were greater than they had been earlier in the expansion.
