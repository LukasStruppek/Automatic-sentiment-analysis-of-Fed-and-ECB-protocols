[" Messrs. Angell and Lindsey dissented because they believed that monetary policy was overly accommodative and needed to be adjusted promptly toward a more neutral stance to counter potential inflationary pressures in the economy. They referred to the long lags with which monetary policy exerts its effects on inflation and the consequent need to adjust monetary policy on a timely basis to foster the Committee's long-run objective of stable prices. They understood the difficulty of finding the appropriate circumstances for tightening actions so as to avoid unintended interpretations and repercussions in financial markets. In their judgment, economic and financial conditions were unlikely to be more favorable later and waiting risked undesirable inflationary consequences. "]
