[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a strong advance in economic activity in recent months. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably further in November, and the civilian unemployment rate fell considerably to 6.4 percent. Industrial production increased sharply in October and November, partly reflecting a continuing rebound in the output of motor vehicles. Retail sales were up moderately in November after, a large increase in October. Housing starts advanced substantially in November. Business equipment expenditures have been rising rapidly, and nonresidential construction has turned up from depressed levels. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in October was about unchanged from its average rate in the third quarter. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices suggest little change in inflation trends, although prices of some raw materials have increased recently. ']
