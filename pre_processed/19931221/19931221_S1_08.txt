[' Business spending for durable equipment apparently continued to rise rapidly. Among nondefense capital goods other than aircraft, shipments of computers and other durable equipment were significantly higher in October than in the third quarter. In addition, the demand for heavy trucks remained strong, and the brisk sales of light vehicles in October and November likely were the result in part of a step-up in spending by businesses. Nonresidential construction activity increased again in October: Office building declined further and industrial construction retraced part of a sizable September gain, but outlays for institutional, public utilities, and non-office commercial structures continued to move higher.
