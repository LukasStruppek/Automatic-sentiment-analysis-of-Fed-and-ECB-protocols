[' The members expected growth in real business investment to remain robust in 1994 but to decelerate somewhat from the rapid rate of expansion over the past year. Continuing increases in business sales and low financing costs along with ongoing efforts to improve productivity were likely to remain conducive to substantial further growth in overall spending for business equipment despite persisting weakness in aerospace and defense-related industries. Nonresidential construction activity, including commercial and industrial building and infrastructure construction, displayed signs of considerable strength in some parts of the country; and declining vacancy rates pointed to a leveling out or even a pickup in nonresidential building construction in a number of other areas. Some expansion in inventories seemed likely over the forecast horizon to accommodate the continuing growth in overall demands. In this connection, members noted that a rise in inventories probably contributed to the expansion in production in recent months since the latter could not be explained entirely by the strength of final demand, and a buildup of motor vehicle stocks in late 1993 was likely to continue into the early part of 1994.
