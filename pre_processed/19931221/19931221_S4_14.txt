[" At this meeting the Committee considered a request from Mr. Henry B. Gonzalez, Chairman of the House Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs, for access by his staff to the tape recording and transcript of the Committee's telephone conference on October 15, 1993. The main purpose of the conference call was to discuss what position the Committee should take on the release of material about its deliberations that are contained in historical files of meeting transcripts; the issue undoubtedly would be raised in the near future, probably during upcoming testimony before Chairman Gonzalez' Committee on October 19, 1993.
