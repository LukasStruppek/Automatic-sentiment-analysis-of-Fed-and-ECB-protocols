[' Members commented that there were few indications of any change in inflationary trends in broad measures of prices and wages despite the surge in economic activity in recent months and associated increases in capacity utilization rates. One important sign of growing inflationary pressures, rising lead times for deliveries of materials, had not emerged. Some members noted that while capacity usage rates were approaching or had reached levels that in the past had tended to signal the onset of rising inflation, the growth of competition stemming from the internationalization of numerous markets suggested that old capacity benchmarks might no longer apply and, especially in the context of excess capacity in many foreign economies, the potential inflationary effects of strong domestic demand pressures might remain subdued for some period of time. In keeping with these assessments, members again reported on the absence of inflationary cost pressures in local areas across the country and on persisting comments by business contacts regarding their inability to raise prices to achieve more satisfactory or customary profit margins. Business executives continued to look to improvements in productivity to maintain or increase their margins, and there were numerous reports of considerable success in implementing productivity gains. Price developments in commodity markets presented a mixed picture; higher food prices stemming from weather conditions earlier in the year had had an adverse effect on broad measures of prices, but the drop in energy prices had favorable implications for the near-term inflation outlook.
