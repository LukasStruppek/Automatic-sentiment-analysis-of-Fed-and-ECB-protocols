[" Mr. Angell also stressed that the Committee should focus more directly on forward-looking indicators such as the price of gold and the estimate of the natural rate of interest provided by the rate on five-year Treasury notes. He favored an immediate increase of 50 basis points in the federal funds rate, which would enable the Committee to observe how the market adjusted the price of gold to the changed opportunity cost of holding gold. He believed that if bond market participants concluded that the Committee was using the price of gold to target the price level, five-year and ten-year interest rates would then be significantly lower than if the Committee's tightening was a belated response to a worsening outlook for inflation. He emphasized that the objective of monetary policy clearly should be stable money which produces stable prices and an ongoing optimal and stable economic growth path. "]
