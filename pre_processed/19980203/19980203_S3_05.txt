[' Members viewed further growth in consumer spending as likely to remain the major factor in sustaining the expansion in overall economic activity. Consumer sentiment was at or close to historically high levels according to recent surveys, evidently reflecting the strong uptrend in employment and income and to some extent the very large cumulative increase in stock market wealth over the course of recent years. Some also noted that consumer debt burdens, while large, were manageable and that such burdens would be lessened for many consumers by their refinancing of home mortgages at the lower mortgage rates now prevailing. Evidence of strength in the consumer sector was supported by upbeat anecdotal reports of retail sales during the holiday season and more recently. While the growth in personal expenditures was likely to moderate somewhat from its recent pace, members did not rule out a more ebullient consumer sector in the context of substantial further growth in disposable incomes, favorable financing conditions for purchases of homes, automobiles, and other consumer durables, and the high level of stock market prices.
