[' The pace of business inventory investment evidently picked up somewhat in the fourth quarter. In manufacturing, inventories climbed further in November (latest monthly data available), and the stock-shipments ratio was at the top of its narrow range for the past twelve months. The accumulation of wholesale stocks continued its strong upward trend, and by November the inventory-sales ratio for the wholesale sector had reversed its 1996 decline. In the retail sector, inventories declined slightly in November after having changed little in October; the inventory-sales ratio for this sector was near the bottom of its range for the last twelve months.
