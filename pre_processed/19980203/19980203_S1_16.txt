[' M2 and M3 continued to grow at relatively rapid rates in December and apparently also in January. Recent gains in nominal income evidently underpinned much of the greater-than-expected strength in M2 in January; also contributing were a pickup in mortgage refinancing activity and, perhaps, depositor transfers of funds from market instruments whose yields had declined relative to those on M2 assets. Large increases in repurchase agreements contributed to rapid growth of M3 in January; the rise in M3 helped to finance further solid expansion of bank credit. From the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997, M2 increased at a rate somewhat above the upper bound of its range for the year and M3 at a rate substantially above the upper bound of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded in 1997 at a pace somewhat below the middle of its range, reflecting the slow rise in the federal debt. ']
