[' The longer-run outlook for inflation was more clouded and under some scenarios less promising. Inflation expectations had been moving down according to recent surveys, and in the context of relatively modest increases in consumer prices expected over coming months such expectations could continue to move lower, thereby constraining increases in compensation and prices. Nonetheless, some of the factors that had helped to moderate price increases--including declining oil prices, the appreciation of the dollar, and restrained increases in health insurance costs--were not likely to continue to exert benign effects on inflation as time went on. More fundamentally, the productivity improvement that had held down producer costs could not necessarily be counted on to continue to offset such costs, especially if the economic expansion remained sufficiently rapid to put additional pressures on available labor resources.
