[' Residential construction activity had remained relatively robust in recent months and was expected to be well maintained over coming quarters. Positive indications for the housing outlook included relatively low mortgage interest rates, very favorable measures of cash-flow affordability, and quite positive home-buying attitudes as expressed in recent surveys.

On balance, only modest, if any, slippage from current levels of home construction activity seemed likely over the year ahead. ']
