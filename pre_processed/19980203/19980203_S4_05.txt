[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity continued to grow rapidly during the closing months of 1997. Nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply further in December after posting very large gains in other recent months; the civilian unem ployment rate, at 4.7 percent, remained near its low for the current economic expansion. Industrial production continued to advance at a brisk pace in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending rose appreciably in the quarter, and housing starts remained close to the highs of the current expansion. Business fixed investment weakened following exceptionally strong increases in the second and third quarters; nonfarm inventory accumulation appears to have picked up somewhat. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed significantly on average in October and November from its level in the third quarter. Price inflation has remained subdued despite appreciably faster increases in worker compensation in recent months. ']
