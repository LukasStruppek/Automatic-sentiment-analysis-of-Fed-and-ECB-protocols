[' Housing demand continued to exhibit considerable strength at year-end in the context of sharp declines in fixed mortgage rates in recent months, further sizable gains in employment and household income, and very positive consumer assessments of homebuying conditions. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes increased to a new monthly high in December; the pace of sales of existing homes rose further in the fourth quarter; and sales of new homes in November (latest available monthly data) were at their highest monthly pace in more than ten years. Housing starts edged lower in December but remained close to the highs of the current expansion. ']
