[' The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that the expansion of economic activity would slow appreciably during the next few quarters and remain moderate in 1999. The staff analysis suggested that slower growth abroad and the considerable rise that already had occurred in the foreign exchange value of the dollar would exert substantial restraint on the demand for U.S. exports and subject domestic producers to even stiffer competition from imports. An anticipated reduction in the desired rate of inventory accumulation would add to the restraint on the expansion. As output growth slowed, pressures on resources would be expected to diminish somewhat. None- theless, it was expected that, consistently measured, inflation would increase to some degree over the ensuing period through 1999, owing in part to an abatement of restraining forces from foreign exchange and oil markets.
