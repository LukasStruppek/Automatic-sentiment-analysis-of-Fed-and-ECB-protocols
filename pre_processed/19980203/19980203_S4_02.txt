[" In the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting adjustments to policy, all the members agreed that prevailing uncertainties indicated the desirability of retaining a symmetric instruction in the directive. While a number of members expressed the view that the next policy move was likely to be a tightening action and one member saw a greater probability of an easing action, the uncertainties were sufficiently great to warrant remaining sensitive to the need for a policy change in either direction. Accordingly, a symmetric directive would signal the Committee's readiness to respond promptly to developments that might threaten the economy's satisfactory performance. "]
