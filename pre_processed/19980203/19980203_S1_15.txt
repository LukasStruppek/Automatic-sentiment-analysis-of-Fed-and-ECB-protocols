[' In foreign exchange markets, the dollar appreciated on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar rose considerably further against the currencies of many of the emerging market economies in Asia amid continuing market concerns about the adequacy of reforms that would be undertaken in the affected countries and the magnitude and availability of international financial assistance that would be needed to support those efforts. The dollar also gained slightly on average in relation to the currencies of the other G-10 currencies. A sizable advance by the dollar relative to the German mark was largely reversed late in the intermeeting period; incoming information suggesting greater strength in the German economy lifted the value of the mark and tended to offset growing concern about the likely effect of the Asian crisis on Germany. The dollar declined somewhat on balance against the yen as heightened prospects for domestic fiscal stimulus in Japan fostered hopes of a less weak performance of the Japanese economy. ']
