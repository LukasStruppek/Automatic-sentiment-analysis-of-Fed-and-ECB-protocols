[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that the performance of the economy continued to be quite favorable. They noted that the economy had entered the new year with considerable momentum and very few indications that growth was moderating from what appeared to be an unsustainable rate. Nonetheless, their assessments of the various factors bearing on the outlook led them to conclude that appreciably slower economic growth was in the offing for the year ahead, possibly to a pace in the vicinity of current estimates of the economy's long- run growth potential. Many emphasized that the prospects for declining net exports as a consequence of the dollar's appreciation and the crises in a number of Asian economies were a key factor in the outlook for some slowing in the expansion. In addition, a moderating rate of inventory accumulation appeared likely after the rapid buildup during 1997. At the same time, high levels of confidence and generally accommodative financial conditions supported expectations of persisting, though likely diminishing, strength in consumer spending and business fixed investment. The members acknowledged that their forecasts were subject to a great deal of uncertainty since there was little precedent to guide them in their evaluation of the extent and likely effect of Asian market turmoil. In the circumstances, the risks of a considerable deviation on the upside or the downside of their current forecasts were unusually high. Partly as a consequence, the outlook for inflation was quite tentative as well. Moreover, questions persisted about the level and growth of sustainable output. Members observed that price inflation had remained subdued, and by some measures had declined, in recent months despite very tight labor markets and indications of somewhat faster increases in labor compensation.
