[' At its meeting on December 16, 1997, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate averaging around 5-1/2 percent. In light of the increased uncertainties in the outlook and the possibility that the next change in policy might be in either direction, the Committee adopted a directive that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Reserve market conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months. ']
