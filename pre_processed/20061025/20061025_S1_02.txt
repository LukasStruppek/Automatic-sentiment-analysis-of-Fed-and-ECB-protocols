The Manager also discussed with the Committee the results of a recent review of the management of the domestic security holdings of the SOMA. The Manager noted that in 2000, in response to reduced issuance of Treasury securities, limits were adopted on the SOMA's holdings of individual Treasury bonds, notes, and bills that ranged between 15 percent and 35 percent of amounts outstanding. In recent years, those limits had created occasional operational complications for the Trading Desk. Meanwhile, circumstances in the Treasury securities market had changed considerably, and the Manager noted that he intended to revert to the previous practice of applying a single 35 percent limit across all issues.
