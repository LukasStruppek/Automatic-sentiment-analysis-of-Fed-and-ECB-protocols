In their discussion of the major sectors of the economy, participants noted that housing activity was likely to remain a substantial drag on economic growth over the next few quarters. Many participants drew some comfort from the most recent data, which suggested that the correction in the housing market was likely to be no more severe than they had previously expected and that the risk of an even larger contraction in this sector had ebbed. But further adjustment in the housing market appeared likely. Single-family housing permits continued to fall and inventories of unsold homes remained at historically high levels. Contacts in the building sector suggested that construction firms were attempting to reduce their backlogs of unsold homes, both by cutting back sharply on new construction and by offering substantial price incentives. Several meeting participants noted the considerable strain on some small- and medium-sized residential construction firms.
