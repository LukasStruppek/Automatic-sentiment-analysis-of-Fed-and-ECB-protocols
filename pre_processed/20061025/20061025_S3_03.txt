To date, weakness in the housing market and the associated downshift in house price appreciation did not seem to be spilling over into consumer spending, which appeared to have grown at a steady pace in recent months. Retail activity in most Districts had been relatively robust and contacts in the retail sector were generally upbeat about the outlook. Several participants noted, however, that contacts within the transportation sector had reported that activity in anticipation of the holiday shopping season appeared to be softer than in previous years. Meeting participants judged that consumer expenditures going forward were likely to expand at a steady pace a little below the growth in disposable income, supported by favorable financial conditions, continued increases in employment and income, and the recent decline in energy prices. Nonetheless, many participants expressed concern that ongoing developments in the housing market could have a more pronounced impact on consumer and other spending, especially if house prices declined significantly.
