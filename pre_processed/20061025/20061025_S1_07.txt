Real consumer spending appeared to regain some steam in September after a lackluster August. Although nominal retail sales fell noticeably in September, the steep drop in gasoline prices more than accounted for the decline. Excluding sales at gasoline stations, the step-up in consumer spending was the result of faster sales of motor vehicles and broad-based strength in outlays for other categories of goods, particularly apparel. Real disposable income rose moderately in both July and August; the pace was somewhat above its second-quarter average. Consumer spending continued to draw support from the lagged effects of the increases in household wealth over the past two years. But interest rates on some types of household loans, both short- and long-term, had risen this year, on balance. The latest readings on consumer sentiment had been positive, perhaps reflecting the recent declines in oil prices. The personal saving rate edged up in August after a dip in July.
