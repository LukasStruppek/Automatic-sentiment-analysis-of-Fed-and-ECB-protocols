Real spending on equipment and software increased at a solid pace during the summer as the fundamental influences on such spending remained favorable for the most part. In particular, although business output had recently been rising at a slower rate, corporate financial reserves remained plentiful and the cost of high-tech capital goods continued to fall. In the high-tech sector, real outlays on communications equipment likely stabilized in August after having surged earlier this year, and the available data suggested that real computer spending picked up in the third quarter. In the transportation sector, business purchases of motor vehicles were brisk of late; the Environmental Protection Agency's regulations on truck emissions that are scheduled to take effect in 2007 likely pulled forward some spending on medium and heavy trucks. Outlays on aircraft appeared to have risen somewhat in the third quarter from their extremely low second-quarter level. Real spending on equipment other than high-tech and transportation items seemed to have retained considerable momentum in the third quarter. Activity in the nonresidential construction sector continued to strengthen in August.
