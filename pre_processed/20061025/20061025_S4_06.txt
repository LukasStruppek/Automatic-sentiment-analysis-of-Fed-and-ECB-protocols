The Committee then continued its discussion of communication issues and considered the advantages and disadvantages of quantifying an inflation objective. Participants stressed that any such step had to be consistent with the statutory objectives for monetary policy. In that regard, it was noted that over time price stability is a prerequisite for maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates. However, the possible specification of a numerical price objective raised a number of complex and interrelated issues that required considerable further discussion. The Committee reached no decisions on these issues at this meeting, and participants agreed to continue the Committee's review of communication issues at its meeting in January 2007.
