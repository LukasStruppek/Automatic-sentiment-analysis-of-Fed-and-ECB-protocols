Residential construction activity remained weak. Single-family starts ticked up in September, but new permit issuance slid further to its lowest level in nearly five years. Construction in the multifamily sector continued to fluctuate within the range that has prevailed for several years. Sales of new single-family homes edged up in August, while sales of existing homes held steady. Pending home sales, which rose somewhat in August after a noticeable drop in July, and the decline in mortgage rates since July likely indicated some support for housing demand in the near term. Still, the overhang of unsold homes remained historically high, and price appreciation of existing homes continued to slow through the second quarter.
