In contrast to the steady expansion of consumer and business investment spending in recent months, several other components of output and demand appeared to have been somewhat weaker than expected. In particular, apparently uncomfortably high levels of inventories within the auto sector had prompted a sharp reduction in light vehicle production in the third quarter. Federal expenditures had been held down by surprisingly weak defense outlays. And strong growth in imports in July and August, driven in part by a surge in oil imports, suggested that net exports probably posed an arithmetic drag on economic growth in the third quarter. However, participants judged that the recent weakness in these components largely reflected temporary influences and was not likely to depress the pace of economic expansion going forward. That said, one participant did note the possibility that the recent decline in oil prices may in part stem from weakness in global demand.
