Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors in the third quarter was estimated to be expanding at around its second-quarter pace. Business debt rose more moderately as bank lending to businesses slowed. In particular, bank lending to finance commercial real estate activity waned in August and September, while commercial and industrial loans, which had been expanding briskly for many months, slowed sharply in September. In the household sector, the further slowing of the rate of increase of house prices appeared to have continued to weigh on the expansion of mortgage debt in the third quarter. M2 grew slowly in the third quarter, exhibiting the lagged effects of earlier increases in opportunity costs and the slow rise in nominal spending.
