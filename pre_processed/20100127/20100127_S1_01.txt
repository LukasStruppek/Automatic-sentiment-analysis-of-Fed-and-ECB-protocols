 The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets during the period since the Committee met on December 15-16, 2009 Financial market conditions remained supportive of economic growth, though volatility in securities markets increased notably toward the end of the intermeeting period Year-end funding pressures were minimal No market strains had appeared as a result of the imminent closing, on February 1, of most of the Federal Reserve's special liquidity facilities The Manager also reported on System open market operations in agency debt and agency MBS during the intermeeting period The Desk continued to gradually slow the pace of its purchases of these securities as it moved toward completing the Committee's program of asset purchases by March 31 The Desk also continued to engage in dollar roll transactions in agency MBS securities to facilitate settlement of its outright purchases The Federal Reserve's total assets remained a bit above $22 trillion, as the increase in the System's holdings of securities was almost entirely offset by a further decline in usage of the System's credit and liquidity facilities By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's transactions Participants agreed that the Desk should continue the interim approach of not reinvesting the proceeds of maturing or prepaid agency securities and MBS held by the Federal Reserve The Desk had continued to reinvest the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities by acquiring newly auctioned Treasury securities issued on the same day its existing holdings matured; participants agreed that the Desk should continue this practice for now, but the Committee would consider further its policy for redeeming or reinvesting maturing Treasury securities There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period
