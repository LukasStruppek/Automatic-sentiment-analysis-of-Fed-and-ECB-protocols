With Mr. Broaddus dissenting, the Committee voted to extend for one year beginning in mid-December 2000 the reciprocal currency ("swap") arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico. The arrangement with the Bank of Canada is in the amount of $2 billion equivalent and that with the Bank of Mexico in the amount of $3 billion equivalent. Both arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve's participation in the North American Framework Agreement, which was established in 1994. Mr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that the swap lines existed primarily to facilitate foreign exchange market intervention, and he was opposed to such intervention for the reasons he had expressed at the February meeting.
