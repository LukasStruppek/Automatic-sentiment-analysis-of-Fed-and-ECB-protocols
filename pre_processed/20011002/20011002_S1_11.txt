Consumer price inflation remained relatively limited in July and August, with core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price inflation on an appreciably lower track than core consumer price index (CPI) inflation. For the twelve months ending in August, core PCE prices rose a bit less, and core CPI prices a bit more, than over the previous twelve-month period. Consumer energy prices fell sharply in July and August, but a sizable rebound was anticipated in September as prices of petroleum products moved higher after midsummer in response to refinery disruptions and tightening supplies. In electricity markets, upward price pressures dissipated over the summer, while the sharp run-up of natural gas prices continued to unwind as inventories rose further in the context of persisting high levels of production and sluggish demand. At the producer level, core prices declined in August, notably at the early stages of processing. With regard to labor costs, the rise in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers diminished somewhat over July and August, but the year-over-year advance was still appreciably above that for the previous twelve-month period. In addition, large increases in health insurance costs were continuing to add to overall employment costs.
