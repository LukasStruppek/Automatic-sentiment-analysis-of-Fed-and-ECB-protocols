The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services was about unchanged in July from its June level, but both exports and imports dropped sharply as weakness in worldwide economic activity continued to affect the nation's foreign trade. The reduced value of exports in July was spread among most trade categories but was especially pronounced in machinery, industrial supplies, and automotive products. The reduction in imports was led by declines in oil, semiconductors, other machinery, automotive products, and consumer goods. Data for foreign industrial economies confirmed earlier indications of little or no growth in those economies in the second quarter, and more recent information for the period prior to the terrorist attacks pointed to further weakness, including evidence of declining activity in Japan. Available information on conditions in major developing countries also suggested slowing or negative growth in recent months, in part as a consequence of weakness in their exports to the United States and, notably for some Asian economies, the poor performance of the global high-tech industry.
