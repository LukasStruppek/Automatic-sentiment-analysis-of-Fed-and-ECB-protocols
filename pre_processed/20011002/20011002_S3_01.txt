developments, the members focused on the shock to consumer and business confidence occasioned by the events of September 11 and the adverse repercussions on an already weak economy. The economy appeared to have been growing very little, if at all, prior to the terrorist attacks, and the dislocations arising from the latter seemed to have induced a downturn in overall economic activity against the backdrop of heightened anxiety and uncertainty about economic prospects and a sharp drop, at least initially, in stock prices after the equity markets reopened on September 17. Looking ahead, the members generally saw a relatively mild and short contraction followed by a gradual recovery next year as a plausible forecast but one that was subject to an unusually wide range of uncertainty, notably in the direction of a potentially much weaker outcome in the nearer term. In the short period since the attacks, anecdotal reports provided indications of a rebound from the sharp cutback in spending that characterized the immediate aftermath of those tragic events, but on balance business activity seemed to be in the process of moving lower. It was especially difficult to assess the outlook for consumer sentiment and spending in the period immediately ahead, which likely would depend to an important extent on the progress of the war against terrorism and reactions to any further terrorist activities. One risk bearing on that outlook was the possibility that prices in equity markets might continue to decline and perhaps even overadjust to lower earnings expectations. The confluence of worldwide economic weakness added to current uncertainties and concerns. In these circumstances a substantial further drop in consumer and business confidence and spending could not be ruled out.
