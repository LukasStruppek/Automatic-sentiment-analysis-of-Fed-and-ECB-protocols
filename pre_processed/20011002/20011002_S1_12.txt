At its meeting on August 21, 2001, the Committee adopted a directive that called for implementing conditions in reserve markets consistent with a reduction of 25 basis points in the intended level of the federal funds rate to a level of about 3-1/2 percent. The Committee took this action in light of the absence of firm evidence that the deceleration in the economic expansion had run its course or that a recovery in output was imminent. With increasing slack in labor and product markets and with inflation expectations contained, the members agreed that the balance of risks continued to be weighted toward conditions that could generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. Subsequently, on September 17, the Committee reduced its target for the federal funds rate by a further Àù percentage point. This action was taken against the backdrop of heightened concerns and uncertainty created by the recent terrorist attacks and their potentially adverse effects on asset prices and the performance of the economy. In conjunction with this easing move, the Federal Reserve indicated that it would continue to supply unusually large volumes of liquidity, and the Committee recognized that the federal funds rate might fall below its new target until the normal functioning of financial markets was restored.
