Growth of M2 remained relatively robust in July and August, though below the average pace in the first half of the year, while the expansion of M3 weakened markedly over the two months. More recently, a record surge in M2 components in the week ending September 17, which was largely reversed in the following week, resulted in very rapid growth in both aggregates on a monthly average basis in September. In the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks, disruptions to the infrastructure of financial markets, including communications and transportation facilities, led to massive dislocations in the distribution of deposits and reserves. At the same time, greatly heightened demand for safe and liquid assets encouraged shifts from equity markets into deposit assets. These financial disturbances called for and were accommodated by record infusions of Federal Reserve credit through open market operations, the discount window, and other sources. In addition, the Federal Reserve eased its rules for lending securities to dealers and took a number of other steps to facilitate the operation of financial markets. To a considerable extent, more normal functioning was restored to those markets by the latter part of September, and the unusual demand for reserves abated.
