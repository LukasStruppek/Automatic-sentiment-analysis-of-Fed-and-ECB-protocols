[' Retail sales weakened somewhat over June and July following several months of robust growth. Sales of motor vehicles were down in both months, and spending on other goods rose sluggishly on balance. Housing starts fell somewhat further in July, reflecting a sizable decline in single-family starts that more than offset a bounceback in multifamily starts. The drop in housing starts, coupled with lower sales of new and existing homes in June (latest data available), suggested that the rise in mortgage rates was exerting a damping effect on housing demand and homebuilding activity.
