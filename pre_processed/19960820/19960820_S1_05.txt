[' Private nonfarm payroll employment increased relatively rapidly in July, though at a considerably slower pace than in the second quarter. Job growth in the services industry slowed sharply, and manufacturing employment declined appreciably after having risen somewhat in the second quarter. In contrast, the expansion in employment in wholesale and retail trade picked up slightly in July, and the number of jobs in construction continued to increase at about the second-quarter pace. The average workweek for private production or nonsupervisory workers fell considerably in July, to a level a little below its average for the second quarter, and the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 5.4 percent. Industrial production rose slightly further in July after three consecutive months of strong gains; manufacturing production expanded less rapidly, and electricity generation dropped sharply as a result of unseasonably cool weather. A substantial increase in the production of motor vehicles and parts accounted for most of the advance in manufacturing output. Elsewhere, the manufacture of office and computing equipment continued on its strong upward trend in July while the production of other business equipment slipped. The output of consumer goods edged lower after having risen slightly in May and June. The rate of utilization of total industrial capacity declined a little in July but remained at a relatively high level. ']
