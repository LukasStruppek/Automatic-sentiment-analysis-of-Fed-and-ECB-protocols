[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in economic activity recently has moderated somewhat. Private nonfarm payroll employment grew less rapidly in July, the average workweek fell sharply, and the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 5.4 percent. Industrial production increased slightly in July after three months of strong gains. Real consumer spending weakened somewhat on balance over June and July following several months of robust growth. Housing starts fell somewhat further in July. Growth in spending on business equipment and nonresidential structures has slowed after a very rapid expansion earlier in the year. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in the second quarter from its rate in the first quarter. Increases in labor compensation have been somewhat larger this year, but consumer price inflation, adjusted for food and energy prices, has remained on a fairly steady trend. ']
