[" In the course of the Committee's discussion, members cited a variety of indications that economic growth was slowing from a very rapid pace, and they pointed to a number of factors that in their view should promote continued, though more moderate, expansion in economic activity. These included generally supportive financial conditions, relatively high levels of consumer confidence, and the absence of major imbalances in the economy. It was noted that much of the stimulus for the strong expansion in the first half of the year had been provided by large increases in spending for consumer durables, housing, and business equipment; however, growth in such spending could be expected to slow in the context of increasingly satisfied pent-up demands and the lagged effects of earlier increases in intermediate- and long-term interest rates on these interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. A key uncertainty in the outlook was the prospective behavior of inventories. Should the expansion in final demand fail to moderate to a sustainable pace, business firms would be likely to intensify their efforts to build their inventories, which currently were widely viewed as satisfactory or even relatively lean in relation to sales. While some buildup in inventories appeared to be occurring in the current quarter, developments that might lead to a sharp increase in inventory investment, such as shortages of various goods and materials and lengthening delays in securing deliveries, were not in evidence at this time. Accordingly, aggressive inventory accumulation remained an upside risk to the projected expansion but not one that was likely to materialize unless final demand were to exceed current forecasts by a significant margin.
