[" In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that on balance the information received since the July meeting, including anecdotal reports from around the nation, pointed to some slowing in the growth of economic activity from a very rapid pace during the spring. The extent of the slowing remained uncertain, and it was unclear at this juncture whether the expansion would slow sufficiently to contain pressures on labor and other producer resources. Nonetheless, broad measures of price inflation, adjusted to exclude their volatile food and energy components, did not exhibit any uptrend despite robust growth in economic activity this year and high levels of resource use. Indeed, some price measures suggested that inflation had trended lower through the second quarter. Moreover, there were no early signs of pressures or imbalances in the industrial sector. In labor markets, however, there were increasing indications of tightness that might at some point feed through to greater inflation. Upward wage adjustments were becoming more evident and increases in overall compensation had edged up, suggesting the possibility of further increases in labor costs at current or higher levels of labor utilization even before taking account of the effects of the rise in the minimum wage. Although increases in compensation might be moderated by greater productivity or absorbed for a time by lower profit margins, the risks seemed tilted toward increases in inflation at some point, especially if the growth of the economy continued to outstrip its potential and added to pressures on resources.
