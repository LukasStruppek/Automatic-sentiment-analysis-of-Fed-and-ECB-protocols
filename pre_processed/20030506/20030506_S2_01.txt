The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest that economic expansion would be sluggish in the near term. Faced with persisting weakness in product and labor markets, businesses and consumers were likely to hold down their spending. In addition, continued slow economic growth in most of the nation's major trading partners would tend to restrain U.S. exports, though those restraints were expected to abate over time. The cumulative effects of an accommodative monetary policy, likely further reduction in taxes, and robust gains in structural productivity would provide significant impetus to spending. Inventory overhangs had been substantially reduced, and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a slowly improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to gradually boost business investment spending. Given the ongoing slack in resource utilization, downward restraint on core price inflation was expected to persist over the forecast period.
