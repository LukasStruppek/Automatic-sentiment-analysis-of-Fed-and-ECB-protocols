A weakening dollar and sluggish economic conditions abroad were key factors impinging on the prospective contribution of the foreign sector to U.S. economic activity. While foreign demand for U.S. products and services would be supported by the dollar's depreciation, relatively weak foreign economic activity would tend to hold down such demand. On balance, the nation's trade deficit was likely to remain at an elevated level, with moderate gains in exports more than offset by larger increases in imports if forecasts of relatively robust U.S. growth in fact materialized.
