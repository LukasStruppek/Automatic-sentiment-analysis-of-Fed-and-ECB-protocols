Real nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles appeared to have declined a little in the first quarter after accumulating in recent quarters. The buildup of manufacturing and trade inventories, however, continued in January and February at an average pace similar to that of the second half of 2002. Relative to sales, non-auto inventory stocks in most sectors were low by recent standards. According to industry reports, inventories in the motor vehicle industry apparently had risen above desired levels.
