Core consumer price inflation moved down further in the first quarter from its already low level. A sharp run-up in energy prices, however, pushed up overall consumer prices in the first quarter and in the year ended in March (measured by both the consumer price index and the chain-type personal consumption expenditure index). Producer prices also were boosted significantly by the jump in energy prices in recent months. Core producer prices were up appreciably in the first quarter but at a slower pace than overall producer prices. With regard to labor costs, the employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers rose at a faster rate during the three months ended in March, reflecting increases in wages and salaries and in benefit costs. The expansion of compensation costs over the twelve months ended in March was virtually the same as in the previous twelve-month period.
