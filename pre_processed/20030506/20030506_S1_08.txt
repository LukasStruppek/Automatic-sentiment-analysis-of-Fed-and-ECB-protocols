Residential housing activity remained solid, though some signs of potential moderation emerged. Supported by continued low mortgage rates, first-quarter housing starts in the single-family sector stayed at the high level of the fourth quarter. Multifamily starts also changed little in the first three months of the year and vacancy rates in the sector remained high. Sales of existing homes were off a bit in March, but sales for the first quarter as a whole edged up from the fourth-quarter rate. New home sales, however, were down from their fourth-quarter pace.
