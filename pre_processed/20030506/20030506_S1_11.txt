The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed slightly in February and brought the average deficit for January and February to an annual rate near that of the fourth quarter. The narrowing in February was accounted for by a small decline in imports and a marginal rise in exports. Recent indicators suggested continued sluggish economic growth in most foreign industrial nations. The Japanese economy was about flat in the early months of the year, activity in the euro area remained subdued, and first-quarter growth in the United Kingdom was lackluster. Canadian domestic demand remained relatively robust but appeared to be slowing. Economic conditions in other countries were mixed. In Latin America, Mexican data releases pointed toward increases in economic activity, and the Argentine economy continued to show signs of recovery. In contrast, Venezuela remained in crisis, and economic activity in Brazil appeared to have moderated despite improved financial market conditions. In developing Asia, indicators suggested that economic growth had slowed in much of the region. China, however, registered robust growth in the first quarter.
