The information reviewed at this meeting suggests further weakening in economic activity. Total nonfarm payroll employment fell sharply further in December and January, reflecting widespread job losses that were especially pronounced in manufacturing and construction; the civilian unemployment rate rose to 6.2 percent in January. Industrial output declined markedly in the fourth quarter, in part because of sizable cutbacks in the production of motor vehicles, and partial data suggest a further drop in January. Consumer spending has remained soft. Advance indicators of business capital spending point to considerable weakness in investment in coming months. Residential construction has declined substantially further in recent months. The nominal U.S. merchan dise trade deficit narrowed in November, as the value of imports declined more than that of exports; the average deficit for October and November exceeded that for the third quarter. Increases in consumer prices moderated and producer prices changed little in November and December, largely as a result of a softening in energy prices. The latest data suggest some further deceleration in wages and overall labor costs.
