[' Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period. The federal funds rate averaged close to 5-3/4 percent, apart from a temporary rise around the end of the third quarter. Other short-term market rates also changed little on balance; market participants continued to anticipate an easing of monetary policy at some point but apparently viewed the chances of near-term easing as small. Longer-term interest rates declined further over the intermeeting period, perhaps in response to a growing conviction that inflation pressures would remain subdued and that substantial reductions in fiscal deficits would be achieved over a period of years. The lower longer-term interest rates, coupled with continuing reports of strong corporate earnings, helped lift major indexes of equity prices to new record levels during the period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined slightly over the intermeeting period. ']
