[" Expansion of the broad monetary aggregates weakened in October. M2 was unchanged in October after having grown relatively rapidly in the third quarter and despite the persistence of low opportunity costs associated with holding M2 assets. For the year through October, M2 expanded at a rate in the upper half of the Committee's range for this aggregate in 1995. Growth of M3 apparently was held down somewhat by the reduced need for additional bank funding during a time of sluggish loan demand; for the year to date, M3 grew at a rate a little above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had risen more slowly in recent months, reflecting reduced expansion of both private and federal borrowing. Nonetheless, for the year to date, this measure of debt remained around the midpoint of its monitoring range. "]
