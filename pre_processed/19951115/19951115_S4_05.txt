[' The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a moderation in the expansion of economic activity after a strong gain in the third quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment increased further in October and the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 5.5 percent. Industrial production fell somewhat in October after a moderate rise in the third quarter. Total nominal retail sales were little changed on balance over September and October. Single-family housing starts were up considerably in the third quarter. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to substantial expansion of spending on business equipment in the near term; nonresidential construction has risen appreciably further. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed over July and August from its average rate in the second quarter. After increasing at elevated rates in the early part of the year, consumer and producer prices have risen more slowly on average in recent months. ']
