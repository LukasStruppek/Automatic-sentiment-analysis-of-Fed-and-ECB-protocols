[" The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the growth of economic activity would slow from the strong third-quarter pace to a rate more in line with the increase in the economy's potential. The forecast assumed that the favorable interest-rate and wealth effects of the extended rally in the debt and equity markets would provide support for a moderate advance in final sales. Consumer spending was expected to expand at a rate generally in line with the growth of incomes; the favorable effects of higher prices on financial assets held by households would be offset to some extent by the difficulties of increasing numbers of households in servicing their growing debts. The greater affordability of housing stemming from the earlier decline in mortgage rates was projected to help sustain homebuilding activity at a relatively high level. In anticipation of reduced growth in sales and profits, business investment in new equipment and structures was projected to slow appreciably from the very rapid pace of the past few years. Strong export expansion would be associated with the improving outlook for the economies of major trading partners. Although substantial uncertainty still surrounded the fiscal outlook, the forecast continued to incorporate a considerable degree of fiscal restraint. In the staff's judgment, wage and price inflation likely would not deviate significantly from recent levels. "]
