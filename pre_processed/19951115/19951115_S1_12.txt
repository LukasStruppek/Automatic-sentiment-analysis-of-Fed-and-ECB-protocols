[' Consumer prices rose at a slightly faster rate in October; with a smaller increase in food prices offsetting higher energy prices, the index for items other than food and energy also picked up a little. For the four months ending in October, prices for nonfood, non-energy items advanced at a rate well below that of earlier in the year. Producer prices of finished goods edged down in October, reflecting a further decline in the prices of finished energy goods. Excluding food and energy, producer prices were unchanged in October and increased at a slower pace in the third quarter than in the first half of the year. Growth in total nominal hourly compensation of private industry workers slowed in the third quarter and, on a year-over-year basis, continued to trend down: the decrease in compensation growth over the past year spanned most major occupations and industries.
