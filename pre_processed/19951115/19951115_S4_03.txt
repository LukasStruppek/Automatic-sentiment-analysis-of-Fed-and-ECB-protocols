[" In the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting adjustments to monetary policy, a majority of the members expressed a preference for retaining a symmetric directive. In their view, the potential need to adjust policy during the relatively short intermeeting period was remote and some of these members also believed that the direction of the next adjustment to policy was uncertain. A few also noted that the adoption of a biased intermeeting instruction at this point might send an unintended message regarding the prevailing view within the Committee concerning the risks to the expansion. The remaining members said that they preferred a directive that was tilted toward an easing policy action. Such an instruction in the directive would be consistent with what they viewed as the most likely policy course over coming months. They agreed, however, that the current uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook were not likely to be resolved during the weeks immediately ahead and since no policy action was likely to be required in this period, they could accept a symmetric directive.
