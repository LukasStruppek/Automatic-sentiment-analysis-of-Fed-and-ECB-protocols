[" In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all but one member favored or could accept an unchanged policy stance. This policy position took account of current indications of a generally acceptable rate of economic growth and the absence of any clear signs regarding the future strength of the expansion in relation to the economy's potential or the future course of inflation. Several commented that current monetary policy might be viewed as somewhat restrictive, though the degree of restraint was difficult to calibrate and it did not appear as yet to be inhibiting declines in intermediate- and long-term interest rates, increases in stock prices, or the availability of financing from lending institutions.
