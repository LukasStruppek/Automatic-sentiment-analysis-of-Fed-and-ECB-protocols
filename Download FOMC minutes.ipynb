Fisher was selected to serve at\\r\\nthe pleasure of the Committee as Manager, System Open Market Account,\\r\\non the understanding that his selection was subject to being\\r\\nsatisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n         Secretary\\'s note:  Advice subsequently was received\\r\\n         that the selection of Mr. Fisher as Manager was\\r\\n         satisfactory to the board of directors of the Federal\\r\\n         Reserve Bank of New York.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tOn the recommendation of the Manager, the Committee at this\\r\\nmeeting unanimously approved two changes in the Authorization for\\r\\nDomestic Open Market Operations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFirst, the Committee amended paragraph 1(a) of the Authorization\\r\\nto raise from $8 billion to $12 billion the limit on intermeeting\\r\\nchanges in System account holdings of U.S. government and federal\\r\\nagency securities.  The increase was the first permanent change in the\\r\\nlimit since February 1990 when it was raised from $6 billion to $8\\r\\nbillion.  The Manager indicated that the Committee had approved\\r\\ntemporary increases several times during the past year and that the\\r\\nexistence of a permanent $12 billion limit would have obviated the\\r\\nneed for most of the increases.  A permanent increase to $12 billion\\r\\nwould reduce the the number of occasions requiring special Committee\\r\\naction, while still calling the need for particularly large changes to\\r\\nthe Committee\\'s attention.  The Committee concurred in the Manager\\'s\\r\\nview that a $4 billion increase was appropriate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tSecond, the Committee terminated the Manager\\'s authority to\\r\\nconduct transactions in bankers acceptances.  This involved the\\r\\ndeletion of paragraph 1(b), which authorized purchases or sales of\\r\\nprime bankers acceptances in the open market, and also the deletion of\\r\\nthe reference in paragraph 1(c), which authorized repurchase\\r\\nagreements in such market instruments.  The Manager indicate that\\r\\noperations in bankers acceptances were not a practical means of\\r\\naffecting reserves under current circumstances, given the ample\\r\\navailability of U.S. Treasury obligations in the market.  Indeed, the\\r\\nCommittee previously had decided in 1977 to suspend transactions on an\\r\\noutright basis in bankers acceptances and had completed the System\\'s\\r\\ndisengagement from this market in 1984 by instructing the Manager to\\r\\ndiscontinue the use of repurchase agreements involving bankers\\r\\nacceptances.  While those decisions had left open the possibility\\r\\nresuming transactions in bankers acceptances and no changes had been\\r\\nmade in the Authorization, the Committee agreed that the existing\\r\\nauthority no longer served a practical purpose.  Accordingly, the\\r\\namended Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was\\r\\nunanimously approved in the form shown below.\\r\\n\\nAuthorization for Domestic Open Market Operations\\r\\n                       Amended February 3, 1998\\r\\n\\r\\n  1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the\\r\\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out\\r\\nthe most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the\\r\\nCommittee:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n     (a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, including\\r\\nsecurities of the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are\\r\\ndirect obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and\\r\\ninterest by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from\\r\\nor to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts\\r\\nmaintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash,\\r\\nregular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market\\r\\nAccount at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange maturing\\r\\nU.S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the\\r\\nindividual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement;\\r\\nprovided that the aggregate amount of U.S. Government and Federal\\r\\nagency securities held in such Account (including forward commitments)\\r\\nat the close of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at\\r\\nwhich action is taken with respect to a domestic policy directive\\r\\nshall not be increased or decreased by more than $12.0 billion during\\r\\nthe period commencing with the opening of business on the day\\r\\nfollowing such meeting and ending with the close of business on the\\r\\nday of the next such meeting;\\r\\n     (b) To buy U.S. Government securities and securities that are\\r\\ndirect obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and\\r\\ninterest by, any agency of the United States, from dealers for the\\r\\naccount of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for\\r\\nrepurchase of such securities or obligations in 15 calendar days or\\r\\nless, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the\\r\\nCommittee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying\\r\\nreasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual\\r\\ndealers; provided that in the event Government securities or agency\\r\\nissues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the dealer\\r\\npursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in\\r\\nthe market or transferred to the System Open Market Account.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n  2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market\\r\\noperations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs\\r\\nthe Federal Reserve Banks to lend U.S. Government securities held in\\r\\nthe System Open Market Account to Government securities dealers and to\\r\\nbanks participating in Government securities clearing arrangements\\r\\nconducted through a Federal Reserve Bank, under such instructions as\\r\\nthe Committee may specify from time to time.\\r\\n\\r\\n  3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market\\r\\noperations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments\\r\\nfor foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal\\r\\nReserve Bank of New York, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes\\r\\nand directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open\\r\\nMarket Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such foreign and\\r\\ninternational accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under\\r\\nagreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those\\r\\nsecurities within 15 calendar days on terms comparable to those\\r\\navailable on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York\\r\\nBank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to\\r\\nthe conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in\\r\\nparagraph l(b), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency\\r\\nsecurities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase\\r\\nagreements between its own account and foreign and international\\r\\naccounts maintained at the Bank.  Transactions undertaken with such\\r\\naccounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a\\r\\nservice fee when appropriate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWith Mr. Jordan dissenting, the Authorization for Foreign\\r\\nCurrency Operations shown below was reaffirmed.\\nAuthorization for Foreign Currency Operations \\r\\n                     Reaffirmed February 3, 1998\\n\\r\\n  1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the\\r\\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to\\r\\nthe extent necessary to carry out the Committee\\'s foreign currency\\r\\ndirective and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant\\r\\nthereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the\\r\\nCommittee may issue from time to time:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     A. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the\\r\\nform of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the\\r\\nopen market at home and abroad, including transactions with the U.S.\\r\\nTreasury, with the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by\\r\\nSection 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary\\r\\nauthorities, with the Bank for International Settlements, and with\\r\\nother international financial institutions:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n                           Austrian schillings\\r\\n                           Belgian francs\\r\\n                           Canadian dollars\\r\\n                           Danish kroner\\r\\n                           Pounds sterling\\r\\n                           French francs\\r\\n                           German marks\\r\\n                           Italian lire\\r\\n                           Japanese yen\\r\\n                           Mexican pesos\\r\\n                           Netherlands guilders\\r\\n                           Norwegian kroner\\r\\n                           Swedish kronor\\r\\n                           Swiss francs\\n\\n\\r\\n     B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts\\r\\nto receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A\\r\\nabove.\\r\\n\\r\\n     C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw\\r\\ndollars under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph\\r\\n2 below, provided that drawings by either party to any such\\r\\narrangement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any\\r\\namount outstanding at that time was first drawn, unless the Committee,\\r\\nbecause of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay.\\r\\n\\r\\n     D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies\\r\\nnot exceeding $25.0 billion.  For this purpose, the overall open\\r\\nposition in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding\\r\\nsigns) of net positions in individual currencies.  The net position in\\r\\na single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that\\r\\ncurrency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus\\r\\noutstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as\\r\\nthe sum of these elements with due regard to sign.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n  2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve\\r\\nBank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements (\"swap\"\\r\\narrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a\\r\\nmaximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among\\r\\nthose designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\\r\\nSystem under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign\\r\\nBanks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew\\r\\nsuch arrangements on maturity:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n  Foreign bank     Amount of arrangement   (millions of dollars equivalent)\\n\\n\\nAustrian National Bank    250\\n\\n\\nNational Bank of Belgium    1,000\\n\\n\\n Bank of Canada   2,000\\n\\n\\nNational Bank of Denmark   250 \\n\\n\\n  Bank of England  3,000\\n\\n\\n Bank of France  2,000\\n\\n\\n German Federal Bank 6,000 \\n\\n\\nBank of Italy   3,000 \\n\\n\\n Bank of Japan   5,000\\n\\n\\nBank of Mexico   3,000 \\n\\n\\n Netherlands Bank 500 \\n\\n\\n Bank of Norway     250\\n\\n\\nBank of Sweden    300\\n\\n\\nSwiss National Bank   4,000 \\n\\n\\n  Bank for International Settlements:\\n\\n\\nDollars against Swiss francs   600 \\n\\n\\nDollars against authorized European  currencies other than Swiss francs   1,250 \\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAny changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the\\r\\nproposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall\\r\\nbe referred for review and approval to the Committee.\\r\\n\\r\\n  3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph\\r\\n1.A. above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the\\r\\nCommittee, be at prevailing market rates.  For the purpose of\\r\\nproviding an investment return on System holdings of foreign\\r\\ncurrencies, or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or\\r\\nreceived in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign\\r\\ncentral banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates.\\r\\n\\r\\n  4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central\\r\\nbanks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions.  In\\r\\nmaking operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System\\r\\nholdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\\r\\nshall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless\\r\\nauthorized by the Federal Open Market Committee.  Any agreements or\\r\\nunderstandings concerning the administration of the accounts\\r\\nmaintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign\\r\\nbanks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of\\r\\nRegulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the\\r\\nCommittee.\\r\\n\\r\\n  5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that\\r\\nadequate liquidity is maintained to meet anticipated needs and so that\\r\\neach currency portfolio shall generally have an average duration of no\\r\\nmore than 18 months (calculated as Macaulay duration).  When\\r\\nappropriate in connection with arrangements to provide investment\\r\\nfacilities for foreign currency holdings, U.S. Government securities\\r\\nmay be purchased from foreign central banks under agreements for\\r\\nrepurchase of such securities within 30 calendar days.\\r\\n\\r\\n  6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs\\r\\nshall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and\\r\\nthe Committee.  The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the\\r\\nChairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the\\r\\nBoard of Governors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman\\r\\nmay designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on\\r\\nthe Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the Chairman as\\r\\nalternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee,\\r\\nhis alternate).  Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the\\r\\nrequest of any member, or at the request of the Manager, System Open\\r\\nMarket Account (\"Manager\"), for the purposes of reviewing recent or\\r\\ncontemplated operations and of consulting with the Manager on other\\r\\nmatters relating to his responsibilities.  At the request of any\\r\\nmember of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and\\r\\nconsultations shall be referred for determination to the Federal Open\\r\\nMarket Committee.\\r\\n\\r\\n  7. The Chairman is authorized:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n     A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed\\r\\nagreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about\\r\\nthe division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between\\r\\nthe System and the Treasury;\\r\\n\\r\\n     B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning\\r\\nSystem foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary\\r\\non policy matters relating to foreign currency operations;\\r\\n\\r\\n     C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and\\r\\ninformation to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary\\r\\nand Financial Policies.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n  8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit\\r\\npertinent information on System foreign currency operations to\\r\\nappropriate officials of the Treasury Department.\\r\\n\\r\\n  9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign\\r\\ncurrency operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3\\r\\nG(1) of the Board of Governors\\' Statement of Procedure with Respect to\\r\\nForeign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWith Mr. Jordan dissenting, the Foreign Currency Directive\\r\\nshown below was reaffirmed.\\r\\n\\nForeign Currency Directive\\r\\n                     Reaffirmed February 3, 1998\\r\\n\\r\\n  1. System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be\\r\\ndirected at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that\\r\\nmarket exchange rates for the U.S. dollar reflect actions and behavior\\r\\nconsistent with the IMF Article IV, Section 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n  2. To achieve this end the System shall:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n     A. Undertake spot and forward purchases and sales of foreign\\r\\nexchange.\\r\\n\\r\\n     B. Maintain reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with\\r\\nselected foreign central banks and with the Bank for International\\r\\nSettlements.\\r\\n\\r\\n     C. Cooperate in other respects with central banks of other\\r\\ncountries and with international monetary institutions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n  3. Transactions may also be undertaken:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n     A. To adjust System balances in light of probable future needs\\r\\nfor currencies.\\r\\n\\r\\n     B. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments\\r\\nin particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange\\r\\nStabilization Fund.\\r\\n\\r\\n     C. For such other purposes as may be expressly authorized by the\\r\\nCommittee.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n  4. System foreign currency operations shall be conducted:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n     A. In close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the\\r\\nUnited States Treasury;\\r\\n\\r\\n     B. In cooperation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary\\r\\nauthorities; and\\r\\n\\r\\n     C. In a manner consistent with the obligations of the United\\r\\nStates in the International Monetary Fund regarding exchange\\r\\narrangements under the IMF Article IV.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMr. Jordan dissented in the votes on the Foreign Currency\\r\\nAuthorization and the Foreign Currency Directive because these policy\\r\\ninstruments provide the basis for foreign exchange market\\r\\ntransactions.  He believes that the primary mission of the Federal\\r\\nReserve is to achieve and maintain a stable purchasing power of the\\r\\nU.S. dollar.  That objective is best achieved when open market\\r\\ntransactions are restricted to purchases and sales of U.S. government\\r\\nsecurities.  When compatible with the System\\'s primary objective,\\r\\nforeign exchange transactions are redundant to open market operations.\\r\\nOften, however, foreign exchange transactions conflict with the\\r\\nSystem\\'s primary objective, requiring opposite adjustments in System\\r\\nholdings of U.S. Treasury obligations.  Moreover, holdings of foreign\\r\\nsecurities expose the Reserve Banks to foreign exchange translation\\r\\nlosses resulting from the depreciation of foreign currencies relative\\r\\nto a strong and stable U.S. dollar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBy unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect\\r\\nto Foreign Currency Operations shown below were reaffirmed.\\r\\n\\nProcedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations \\r\\n                     Reaffirmed February 3, 1998\\r\\n\\r\\n         In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and\\r\\ndirection of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the\\r\\nAuthorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency\\r\\nDirective, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager,\\r\\nSystem Open Market Account (\"Manager\"), shall be guided by the\\r\\nfollowing procedural understandings with respect to consultations and\\r\\nclearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and\\r\\nthe Chairman of the Committee.  All operations undertaken pursuant to\\r\\nsuch clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee.\\r\\n\\r\\n  1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the\\r\\nChairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the\\r\\nSubcommittee is not feasible in the time available):\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n      A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s\\r\\noverall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on\\r\\nany day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the\\r\\nCommittee.\\r\\n\\r\\n      B. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the\\r\\nSystem\\'s net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150\\r\\nmillion, or $300 million when the operation is associated with\\r\\nrepayment of swap drawings.\\r\\n\\r\\n      C. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of\\r\\ntrading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change\\r\\nin the System\\'s net position in that currency might be less than the\\r\\nlimits specified in 1.B.\\r\\n\\r\\n      D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the\\r\\nlarger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap\\r\\narrangement.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n  2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the\\r\\nSubcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the\\r\\nfull Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the\\r\\nChairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the\\r\\nSubcommittee is not feasible in the time available):\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n      A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s\\r\\noverall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion\\r\\nsince the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.\\r\\n\\r\\n      B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the\\r\\nlarger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap\\r\\narrangement.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n  3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the\\r\\nChairman about proposed swap drawings by the System and about any\\r\\noperations that are not of a routine character.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\tOn January 16, 1998, the continuing rules, regulations,\\r\\nauthorizations, and other instructions of the Committee had been\\r\\ndistributed with the advice that, in accordance with procedures\\r\\napproved by the Committee, they were being called to the Committee\\'s\\r\\nattention before the February 3-4 organization meeting to give members\\r\\nan opportunity to raise any questions they might have concerning them.\\r\\nMembers were asked to indicate if they wished to have any of the\\r\\ninstruments in question placed on the agenda for consideration at this\\r\\nmeeting, and no requests for consideration were received.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\tBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal\\r\\nOpen Market Committee held on December 16, 1997, were approved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\tThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on\\r\\ndevelopments in foreign exchange and international financial markets\\r\\nin the period since the previous meeting on December 16, 1997.  There\\r\\nwere no System open market transactions in foreign currencies during\\r\\nthis period, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\tThe Manager of the System Open Market Account also reported\\r\\non developments in domestic financial markets and on System open\\r\\nmarket transactions in government securities and federal agency\\r\\nobligations during the period from December 17, 1997, through February 3,\\r\\n1998.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\tThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and\\r\\nfinancial outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in\\r\\n1998, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting\\r\\nperiod ahead.  A summary of the economic and financial information\\r\\navailable at the time of the meeting and of the Committee\\'s discussion\\r\\nis provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was\\r\\napproved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of\\r\\nNew York.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\t  \\tThe information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the\\r\\neconomy continued to expand at a robust pace during the closing months\\r\\nof 1997.  Both employment and industrial output recorded substantial\\r\\nincreases in the fourth quarter.  While spending for final goods and\\r\\nservices by U.S. residents decelerated noticeably, inventory\\r\\ninvestment strengthened and the deficit in international trade in\\r\\ngoods and services appeared to have narrowed.  Tighter labor markets\\r\\nbrought some acceleration in wages, but falling import and energy\\r\\nprices helped to hold down price inflation over the closing months of\\r\\nthe year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t  \\tLabor demand expanded rapidly in the fourth quarter; a sharp\\r\\nincrease in nonfarm payroll employment in December followed large\\r\\nadvances in October and November, and the average workweek edged up on\\r\\nbalance over the three-month period.  Job gains were widely spread\\r\\nacross industries.  In the fourth quarter, new hires in manufacturing\\r\\naccounted for more than half of that sector\\'s total for the year, and\\r\\nconstruction employment also registered an unusually large rise\\r\\ncompared with earlier in 1997.  Job growth surged in retail trade and\\r\\npersisted at a rapid pace in service-producing industries.  The\\r\\ncivilian unemployment rate, at 4.7 percent in December, was near its\\r\\nlow for the current economic expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t  \\tIndustrial production continued to advance at a brisk pace in\\r\\nthe fourth quarter.  Growth in the manufacturing of durable goods\\r\\nremained strong despite sharply slower, though still substantial,\\r\\nexpansion in the output of computing and office equipment.  The\\r\\nproduction of nondurable goods picked up after having been sluggish\\r\\nearlier in the year.  Capacity utilization in manufacturing was at a\\r\\nrelatively high rate in the fourth quarter, but available information\\r\\nsuggested few bottlenecks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t  \\tConsumer spending, in real terms, rose at a slower though\\r\\nstill appreciable rate in the fourth quarter.  Purchases of durable\\r\\ngoods increased moderately after surging in the third quarter, and\\r\\nspending on nondurables edged down.  By contrast, expenditures for\\r\\nconsumer services grew at a somewhat faster rate.  Recent surveys\\r\\nindicated that consumer confidence remained at a very high level.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t  \\tHousing demand continued to exhibit considerable strength at\\r\\nyear-end in the context of sharp declines in fixed mortgage rates in\\r\\nrecent months, further sizable gains in employment and household\\r\\nincome, and very positive consumer assessments of homebuying\\r\\nconditions.  Applications for mortgages to purchase homes increased to\\r\\na new monthly high in December; the pace of sales of existing homes\\r\\nrose further in the fourth quarter; and sales of new homes in November\\r\\n(latest available monthly data) were at their highest monthly pace in\\r\\nmore than ten years.  Housing starts edged lower in December but\\r\\nremained close to the highs of the current expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t  \\tAfter unusually strong increases earlier in the year, real\\r\\nbusiness fixed investment declined slightly in the fourth quarter.\\r\\nHowever, the outlook for further growth remained positive, with\\r\\ncorporate cash flow still healthy and the user cost of capital still\\r\\nlow.  Data on shipments of nondefense capital goods in December\\r\\nindicated a rebound in business spending on capital goods, notably for\\r\\noffice, computing, and communications equipment, after sizable\\r\\ndeclines in the October-November period.  Business spending on\\r\\nnonresidential structures declined slightly in the fourth quarter\\r\\ndespite rising real estate prices and falling vacancy rates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t  \\tThe pace of business inventory investment evidently picked up\\r\\nsomewhat in the fourth quarter.  In manufacturing, inventories climbed\\r\\nfurther in November (latest monthly data available), and the\\r\\nstock-shipments ratio was at the top of its narrow range for the past twelve\\r\\nmonths.  The accumulation of wholesale stocks continued its strong\\r\\nupward trend, and by November the inventory-sales ratio for the\\r\\nwholesale sector had reversed its 1996 decline.  In the retail sector,\\r\\ninventories declined slightly in November after having changed little\\r\\nin October; the inventory-sales ratio for this sector was near the\\r\\nbottom of its range for the last twelve months.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t    The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services\\r\\nnarrowed substantially on average in October and November from its\\r\\nlevel in the third quarter.  The value of exports rose appreciably in\\r\\nthe October-November period, with the largest increases occurring in\\r\\nautomotive and agricultural products.  The average value of imports\\r\\nfor October and November changed little from the third-quarter rate.\\r\\nImports of consumer goods and machinery rose, but they were about\\r\\noffset by declines in automotive products, computers, and, to a lesser\\r\\nextent, a wide variety of other products.  The available information\\r\\nindicated that economic expansion remained healthy in most of the\\r\\nforeign G-7 countries, although slowing somewhat from the third\\r\\nquarter.  In Asia, weakness in economic activity in Japan continued\\r\\ninto the fourth quarter, and persisting financial turmoil was having\\r\\nstrong adverse effects on the economies of a number of developing\\r\\ncountries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t  \\tConsumer price inflation remained low in December, damped by\\r\\na sizable further drop in energy prices and a small decline in food\\r\\nprices.  Excluding food and energy items, an acceleration in the costs\\r\\nof services, notably medical care and shelter, provided a slight boost\\r\\nto core consumer price inflation in December.  For the year as a\\r\\nwhole, prices of core consumer items rose considerably less than in\\r\\n1996, in part reflecting the effect of declining import prices.  At\\r\\nthe producer level, prices of all finished goods and of the core\\r\\nfinished goods component declined further in December.  For the year\\r\\n1997, the core producer price index was little changed after a\\r\\nrelatively small rise the previous year; the total index, weighed down\\r\\nby falling prices of finished food and energy items, partially\\r\\nreversed its 1996 increase.  Prices also remained subdued at earlier\\r\\nstages of processing in 1997, with prices of crude materials falling\\r\\nsubstantially.  Labor costs, as measured by the hourly compensation of\\r\\nprivate industry workers, increased at appreciably faster rates in the\\r\\nfourth quarter and for the year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tAt its meeting on December 16, 1997, the Committee adopted a\\r\\ndirective that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets\\r\\nthat were consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate averaging\\r\\naround 5-1/2 percent.  In light of the increased uncertainties in the\\r\\noutlook and the possibility that the next change in policy might be in\\r\\neither direction, the Committee adopted a directive that did not\\r\\ninclude a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to\\r\\npolicy during the intermeeting period.  Reserve market conditions\\r\\nassociated with this directive were expected to be consistent with\\r\\nsome moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tOpen market operations were directed throughout the\\r\\n\\t\\tintermeeting period toward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with\\r\\nthe intended federal funds rate average of around 5-1/2 percent, and\\r\\nthe effective rate averaged close to that level despite some largely\\r\\nanticipated upward pressures in reserve markets around year-end.  Most\\r\\nother domestic market interest rates moved down on balance during the\\r\\nintermeeting period, apparently as a result of increased concerns over\\r\\nthe turbulence in Asia and its potential implications for the U.S.\\r\\neconomy.  Share prices in U.S. equity markets moved up slightly on\\r\\nnet, perhaps partly in response to the bond market rally, while equity\\r\\nmarkets in some other countries, notably in Asia, remained unsettled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tIn foreign exchange markets, the dollar appreciated on\\r\\nbalance over the intermeeting period.  The dollar rose considerably\\r\\nfurther against the currencies of many of the emerging market\\r\\neconomies in Asia amid continuing market concerns about the adequacy\\r\\nof reforms that would be undertaken in the affected countries and the\\r\\nmagnitude and availability of international financial assistance that\\r\\nwould be needed to support those efforts.  The dollar also gained\\r\\nslightly on average in relation to the currencies of the other G-10\\r\\ncurrencies.  A sizable advance by the dollar relative to the German\\r\\nmark was largely reversed late in the intermeeting period; incoming\\r\\ninformation suggesting greater strength in the German economy lifted\\r\\nthe value of the mark and tended to offset growing concern about the\\r\\nlikely effect of the Asian crisis on Germany.  The dollar declined\\r\\nsomewhat on balance against the yen as heightened prospects for\\r\\ndomestic fiscal stimulus in Japan fostered hopes of a less weak\\r\\nperformance of the Japanese economy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tM2 and M3 continued to grow at relatively rapid rates in\\r\\nDecember and apparently also in January.  Recent gains in nominal\\r\\nincome evidently underpinned much of the greater-than-expected\\r\\nstrength in M2 in January; also contributing were a pickup in mortgage\\r\\nrefinancing activity and, perhaps, depositor transfers of funds from\\r\\nmarket instruments whose yields had declined relative to those on M2\\r\\nassets.  Large increases in repurchase agreements contributed to rapid\\r\\ngrowth of M3 in January; the rise in M3 helped to finance further\\r\\nsolid expansion of bank credit.  From the fourth quarter of 1996 to\\r\\nthe fourth quarter of 1997, M2 increased at a rate somewhat above the\\r\\nupper bound of its range for the year and M3 at a rate substantially\\r\\nabove the upper bound of its range.  Total domestic nonfinancial debt\\r\\nexpanded in 1997 at a pace somewhat below the middle of its range,\\r\\nreflecting the slow rise in the federal debt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that\\r\\nthe expansion of economic activity would slow appreciably during the\\r\\nnext few quarters and remain moderate in 1999.  The staff analysis\\r\\nsuggested that slower growth abroad and the considerable rise that\\r\\nalready had occurred in the foreign exchange value of the dollar would\\r\\nexert substantial restraint on the demand for U.S. exports and subject\\r\\ndomestic producers to even stiffer competition from imports.  An\\r\\nanticipated reduction in the desired rate of inventory accumulation\\r\\nwould add to the restraint on the expansion.  As output growth slowed,\\r\\npressures on resources would be expected to diminish somewhat.  None-\\r\\ntheless, it was expected that, consistently measured, inflation would\\r\\nincrease to some degree over the ensuing period through 1999, owing in\\r\\npart to an abatement of restraining forces from foreign exchange and\\r\\noil markets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tIn the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective\\r\\neconomic conditions, members commented that the performance of the\\r\\neconomy continued to be quite favorable.  They noted that the economy\\r\\nhad entered the new year with considerable momentum and very few\\r\\nindications that growth was moderating from what appeared to be an\\r\\nunsustainable rate.  Nonetheless, their assessments of the various\\r\\nfactors bearing on the outlook led them to conclude that appreciably\\r\\nslower economic growth was in the offing for the year ahead, possibly\\r\\nto a pace in the vicinity of current estimates of the economy\\'s long-\\r\\nrun growth potential.  Many emphasized that the prospects for\\r\\ndeclining net exports as a consequence of the dollar\\'s appreciation\\r\\nand the crises in a number of Asian economies were a key factor in the\\r\\noutlook for some slowing in the expansion.  In addition, a moderating\\r\\nrate of inventory accumulation appeared likely after the rapid buildup\\r\\nduring 1997.  At the same time, high levels of confidence and generally\\r\\naccommodative financial conditions supported expectations of\\r\\npersisting, though likely diminishing, strength in consumer spending\\r\\nand business fixed investment.  The members acknowledged that their\\r\\nforecasts were subject to a great deal of uncertainty since there was\\r\\nlittle precedent to guide them in their evaluation of the extent and\\r\\nlikely effect of Asian market turmoil.  In the circumstances, the\\r\\nrisks of a considerable deviation on the upside or the downside of\\r\\ntheir current forecasts were unusually high.  Partly as a consequence,\\r\\nthe outlook for inflation was quite tentative as well.  Moreover,\\r\\nquestions persisted about the level and growth of sustainable output.\\r\\nMembers observed that price inflation had remained subdued, and by\\r\\nsome measures had declined, in recent months despite very tight labor\\r\\nmarkets and indications of somewhat faster increases in labor\\r\\ncompensation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tIn keeping with the practice at meetings just prior to the\\r\\nFederal Reserve\\'s semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress\\r\\nand the Chairman\\'s associated testimony, the members of the Committee\\r\\nand the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as\\r\\nmembers had provided individual projections of the growth in real and\\r\\nnominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for\\r\\nthe year ahead.  Based on developments over the second half of 1997,\\r\\nthe central tendency of the projections for 1998 now pointed to\\r\\nslightly more strength in real GDP and appreciably less inflation than\\r\\nthe forecasts prepared at the time of the July 1997 meeting.  The\\r\\nforecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP in 1998 had a central\\r\\ntendency of 2 to 2-3/4 percent and a full range of 1-3/4 to 3 percent.\\r\\nSuch growth was expected to be associated with a civilian unemployment\\r\\nrate in a range of 4-1/2 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter of this\\r\\nyear, implying little or no change from the current level.  With\\r\\nregard to nominal GDP growth in 1998, the forecasts were mainly in a\\r\\nrange of 3-3/4 to 4-1/2 percent, with an overall range of 3-1/2 to 5\\r\\npercent.  Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the\\r\\nconsumer price index, had a central tendency of 1-3/4 to 2-1/4\\r\\npercent, on the high side of the outcome for 1997 when the rise in the\\r\\nindex was held down by damped increases in food prices and declines in\\r\\nenergy prices.  These forecasts took account of likely further\\r\\ntechnical improvements in the CPI by the Bureau of Labor Statistics\\r\\nthat would trim the reported rate.  The projections were based on\\r\\nindividual views concerning what would be an appropriate policy over\\r\\nthe projection horizon to foster the Committee\\'s longer-term goals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tThe members stressed that the potential extent of the\\r\\nnegative effects of developments in Asia on the nation\\'s trade balance\\r\\nrepresented a key uncertainty in the economic outlook.  On the whole,\\r\\nthose effects had been quite limited thus far.  Anecdotal reports\\r\\nindicated that a number of domestic producers, notably of agricul-\\r\\ntural, lumber, and wood products, had experienced some cancellations\\r\\nor postponements of orders from Asian customers and there was some\\r\\nevidence of increased imports from those nations.  Exports to affected\\r\\nAsian nations were likely to be held back by declining incomes and\\r\\nrising prices of U.S. products in local currencies, and reportedly\\r\\nalso by difficulties that importing firms in Asia were encountering in\\r\\nsecuring financing.  The eventual effects of the Asian financial\\r\\nturmoil on the U.S. trade balance and the overall economy were\\r\\nunknown--in part because in some key countries needed reforms had yet\\r\\nto be implemented and markets to stabilize--but they clearly seemed\\r\\nlikely to become more pronounced in coming months.  Net exports also\\r\\nwould be held down by the appreciation of the dollar against the\\r\\ncurrencies of the industrial countries that had occurred earlier in\\r\\n1997 before the Asian crisis intensified.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tAnother factor viewed as likely to exert a moderating effect\\r\\non the growth of economic activity was the expectation of some slowing\\r\\nin inventory investment.  In the past year, businesses had added to\\r\\ninventories at a rate that exceeded the rise in final sales, and\\r\\nsomewhat reduced accumulation to a pace more in line with that of\\r\\nfinal sales was seen as a reasonable expectation.  Some members\\r\\nexpressed reservations, however, about the extent of any weakening in\\r\\ninventory accumulation in light of the relatively favorable economic\\r\\nconditions that they believed were likely to persist over the year\\r\\nahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tMembers viewed further growth in consumer spending as likely\\r\\nto remain the major factor in sustaining the expansion in overall\\r\\neconomic activity.  Consumer sentiment was at or close to historically\\r\\nhigh levels according to recent surveys, evidently reflecting the\\r\\nstrong uptrend in employment and income and to some extent the very\\r\\nlarge cumulative increase in stock market wealth over the course of\\r\\nrecent years.  Some also noted that consumer debt burdens, while\\r\\nlarge, were manageable and that such burdens would be lessened for\\r\\nmany consumers by their refinancing of home mortgages at the lower\\r\\nmortgage rates now prevailing.  Evidence of strength in the consumer\\r\\nsector was supported by upbeat anecdotal reports of retail sales\\r\\nduring the holiday season and more recently.  While the growth in\\r\\npersonal expenditures was likely to moderate somewhat from its recent\\r\\npace, members did not rule out a more ebullient consumer sector in the\\r\\ncontext of substantial further growth in disposable incomes, favorable\\r\\nfinancing conditions for purchases of homes, automobiles, and other\\r\\nconsumer durables, and the high level of stock market prices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tBusiness fixed investment also was expected to provide\\r\\nsubstantial support to continued economic expansion, though some\\r\\nmoderation in purchases of business equipment seemed likely after the\\r\\nexceptionally rapid rates of growth in such investments in recent\\r\\nyears.  Business sentiment remained generally optimistic, and both\\r\\ndebt and equity financing continued to be readily available on\\r\\nattractive terms to most business borrowers.  However, early signs of\\r\\nfaltering profit trends in some industries, in part related to\\r\\ndevelopments in Asia, appeared to have introduced a cautionary note\\r\\namong some business planners.  Members also referred to emerging signs\\r\\nof speculative overbuilding in some areas, especially of commercial\\r\\nstructures.  Even so, in the absence of unanticipated weakness in\\r\\nconsumer expenditures, a variety of favorable factors seemed likely to\\r\\nsustain relatively robust spending on business structures and\\r\\nequipment over the year ahead.  The latter included increased\\r\\nopportunities to cut costs and enhance efficiency by investing in\\r\\nrelatively inexpensive high-tech equipment in a period characterized\\r\\nby strong competition in many markets and rising labor compensation\\r\\nassociated with tight labor markets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tResidential construction activity had remained relatively\\r\\nrobust in recent months and was expected to be well maintained over\\r\\ncoming quarters.  Positive indications for the housing outlook\\r\\nincluded relatively low mortgage interest rates, very favorable\\r\\nmeasures of cash-flow affordability, and quite positive home-buying\\r\\nattitudes as expressed in recent surveys.  While these factors were\\r\\nexpected to help sustain the housing sector over coming months,\\r\\nmembers noted that housing construction had been high for some time\\r\\nand some cited anecdotal evidence of softening activity in some parts\\r\\nof the country.  On balance, only modest, if any, slippage from\\r\\ncurrent levels of home construction activity seemed likely over the\\r\\nyear ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tWith regard to the outlook for inflation, members referred to\\r\\nwidespread indications of increasingly tight labor markets and to\\r\\nstatistical and anecdotal reports of faster increases in labor\\r\\ncompensation.  Labor cost increases in recent quarters had been especially\\r\\nrapid in a large segment of the service sector, where foreign\\r\\ncompetition was not a factor.  Some members commented, however, that\\r\\nthere were reasons to discount the sharp fourth-quarter increase in\\r\\nthe employment cost index because to a large extent it was the result\\r\\nof nonrecurring developments in a limited number of industries.\\r\\nDespite the upward trend in labor compensation, gains in productivity\\r\\nclearly had kept increases in unit labor costs at a very modest level;\\r\\nand with unit nonlabor costs continuing to decline, overall unit cost\\r\\nincreases had remained not far above zero.  In these circumstances--and\\r\\n in the context of highly competitive conditions in many markets,\\r\\ndeclines in input prices and in the prices of many commodities,\\r\\nincluding oil--rising labor costs seemed to pose little risk of an\\r\\nupward impetus to inflation in coming months.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tThe longer-run outlook for inflation was more clouded and\\r\\nunder some scenarios less promising.  Inflation expectations had been\\r\\nmoving down according to recent surveys, and in the context of\\r\\nrelatively modest increases in consumer prices expected over coming months\\r\\nsuch expectations could continue to move lower, thereby constraining\\r\\nincreases in compensation and prices.  Nonetheless, some of the\\r\\nfactors that had helped to moderate price increases--including\\r\\ndeclining oil prices, the appreciation of the dollar, and restrained\\r\\nincreases in health insurance costs--were not likely to continue to\\r\\nexert benign effects on inflation as time went on.  More fundamentally,\\r\\nthe productivity improvement that had held down producer costs\\r\\ncould not necessarily be counted on to continue to offset such costs,\\r\\nespecially if the economic expansion remained sufficiently rapid to\\r\\nput additional pressures on available labor resources.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tIn keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and\\r\\nBalanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee\\r\\nreviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates in\\r\\n1998 that it had established on a tentative basis at its meeting in\\r\\nJuly 1997.  Those ranges included expansion of 1 to 5 percent for M2\\r\\nand 2 to 6 percent for M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to\\r\\nthe fourth quarter of 1998.  The associated range for growth of total\\r\\ndomestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 3 to 7 percent for\\r\\n1998.  The tentative ranges for 1998 were unchanged from the ranges\\r\\nthat had been adopted initially for 1995 (in July of that year for\\r\\nM3).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tIn reviewing the tentative ranges, the members took note of a\\r\\nstaff projection indicating that, given the members\\' expectations for\\r\\nthe performance of the economy and prices and assuming no major\\r\\nchanges in interest rates, M2 likely would grow in 1998 in the upper\\r\\nhalf of its tentative range, and M3 somewhat above the top of its\\r\\nrange.  The staff analysis anticipated that the velocity of M2 would\\r\\ncontinue its recent pattern of relatively stable behavior that was\\r\\nmore in line with historical experience than had been the case in the\\r\\nearly 1990s.  The velocity of M3 was projected to continue to decline\\r\\nat a somewhat faster rate than historical experience would indicate,\\r\\nreflecting the greater use by business firms of institution-only money\\r\\nmarket funds as a cash management tool and the needs of depository\\r\\ninstitutions for appreciable non-M2 funding to finance brisk loan\\r\\ngrowth.  The staff projected that the debt of the domestic\\r\\nnonfinancial sectors would grow around or perhaps slightly above the middle of\\r\\nits tentative range, reflecting the credit needs of businesses facing\\r\\na weaker earnings outlook and larger merger-related retirements of\\r\\nequity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tIn their discussion of the ranges for M2 and M3, the members\\r\\nnoted that the apparently greater predictability of velocity in recent\\r\\nyears could not be counted on to persist, given changes in financial\\r\\nmarkets that had made investment alternatives more readily available.\\r\\nAs a consequence, substantial uncertainty still surrounded projections\\r\\nof money growth consistent with the Committee\\'s basic objectives for\\r\\nmonetary policy.  In this environment, the members did not see any\\r\\nfirm basis for deviating from their recent practice of setting ranges\\r\\nthat, assuming velocity behavior in line with historical patterns,\\r\\nwould serve as benchmarks for monetary expansion consistent with\\r\\nlonger-run price stability and a sustainable rate of real economic\\r\\ngrowth.  The tentative ranges for 1998 had been derived in this way,\\r\\nand Committee members saw no reason to change those ranges at this\\r\\ntime.  Indeed, adjusting the ranges to center them more closely on\\r\\ngrowth rates deemed likely to be more consistent with the Committee\\'s\\r\\nexpectations for economic activity and prices could foster the\\r\\nmisinterpretation that the Committee had become much more confident of\\r\\nthe stability and predictability of velocity and was placing greater\\r\\nemphasis on M2 and M3 as gauges of the thrust of monetary policy.\\r\\nSeveral members commented, however, that the adoption of ranges\\r\\ncentered on the Committee\\'s expectations for growth of the monetary\\r\\naggregates should be reconsidered in the future if the members were to\\r\\nbecome more confident about the relationship between the growth of the\\r\\nmoney and measures of aggregate economic performance.  The Committee\\r\\nalso agreed that the range for nonfinancial debt for 1998 should be\\r\\nleft unchanged.  The tentative range readily encompassed the pace seen\\r\\nas likely to be associated with the members\\' forecasts for economic\\r\\nactivity and prices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tAccordingly, the following statement of longer-run policy for\\r\\n1998 was approved for inclusion in the domestic policy directive:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n     \\tThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\\r\\n     financial conditions that will foster price stability and\\r\\n     promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of\\r\\n     these objectives, the Committee at this meeting\\r\\n     established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5\\r\\n     percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from\\r\\n     the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.\\r\\n     The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt\\r\\n     was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.  The behavior of\\r\\n     the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in\\r\\n     the light of progress toward price level stability,\\r\\n     movements in their velocities, and developments in the\\r\\n     economy and financial markets.\\r\\n\\nVotes for this action:  Messrs. Greenspan,\\r\\n     \\tMcDonough, Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Jordan,\\r\\n     \\tKelley, McTeer, Meyer, and Mses. Minehan, Phillips,\\r\\n     \\tand Rivlin.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\nVotes against this action:  None.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tIn the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting\\r\\nperiod ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an\\r\\nunchanged policy stance.  The economy currently was performing very\\r\\nwell and the outlook over the near term was for subdued inflation and\\r\\ncontinued solid economic growth.  Over a longer horizon, the range of\\r\\npossible outcomes was unusually wide, and the direction that policy\\r\\nwould need to move to promote sustained expansion and damped inflation\\r\\nwas unclear.  At this point, the extent to which the still largely\\r\\nanticipated external drag from events in Asia would offset the strong\\r\\nupward momentum in domestic demand was a source of major uncertainty.\\r\\nIn addition, it was impossible to predict whether or when the tightness\\r\\nin labor markets would exert a more pronounced effect on labor\\r\\ncosts and ultimately on price inflation.  Even the thrust of the\\r\\ncurrent stance of monetary policy as it was transmitted through financial\\r\\nmarkets was open to some question.  On the one hand, a real\\r\\nfederal funds rate that was on the high side of historical experience\\r\\nand a substantially stronger dollar suggested some restraint.  From a\\r\\ndifferent perspective, however, financial conditions seemed to be\\r\\nquite stimulative as evidenced by lower nominal and perhaps real\\r\\nintermediate and long-term interest rates, rising equity prices, ready\\r\\ncredit availability, and rapid growth of the broad measures of money\\r\\nand credit.  While the members differed to some extent in their forecasts of major trends in the economy and in the risks of alternative\\r\\noutcomes, they agreed that, under foreseeable circumstances, needed\\r\\nadjustments to policy probably could be made on a timely basis once\\r\\nthe balance of underlying forces became more evident.  Accordingly, a\\r\\nsteady policy would not incur an unacceptable risk of a seriously\\r\\ndeteriorating economic performance.  In the interim, the greater risk\\r\\nwould be to make a preemptive policy move on the basis of inadequate\\r\\nevidence regarding underlying economic trends.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tIn the Committee\\'s discussion of possible intermeeting\\r\\nadjustments to policy, all the members agreed that prevailing\\r\\nuncertainties indicated the desirability of retaining a symmetric\\r\\ninstruction in the directive.  While a number of members expressed the\\r\\nview that the next policy move was likely to be a tightening action\\r\\nand one member saw a greater probability of an easing action, the\\r\\nuncertainties were sufficiently great to warrant remaining sensitive\\r\\nto the need for a policy change in either direction.  Accordingly, a\\r\\nsymmetric directive would signal the Committee\\'s readiness to respond\\r\\npromptly to developments that might threaten the economy\\'s satisfactory performance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tAt the conclusion of the Committee\\'s discussion, all the\\r\\nmembers indicated their support of a directive that called for\\r\\nmaintaining conditions in reserve markets that were consistent with an\\r\\nunchanged federal funds rate of about 5-1/2 percent, and all also\\r\\nfavored a directive that did not include a presumption about the\\r\\ndirection of a change, if any, in the stance of policy during the\\r\\nintermeeting period.  Accordingly, in the context of the Committee\\'s\\r\\nlong-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic\\r\\ngrowth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and\\r\\nmonetary developments, the members decided that a slightly higher or a\\r\\nslightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the\\r\\nintermeeting period.  The reserve conditions contemplated at this\\r\\nmeeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the\\r\\ngrowth of M2 and M3 over coming months.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t   \\tThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and\\r\\ndirected, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute\\r\\ntransactions in the System Account in accordance with the following\\r\\ndomestic policy directive:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n    \\tThe information reviewed at this meeting suggests\\r\\n    that economic activity continued to grow rapidly during\\r\\n    the closing months of 1997.  Nonfarm payroll employment\\r\\n    increased sharply further in December after posting very\\r\\n    large gains in other recent months; the civilian unem    ployment rate, at 4.7 percent, remained near its low for\\r\\n    the current economic expansion.  Industrial production\\r\\n    continued to advance at a brisk pace in the fourth\\r\\n    quarter.  Consumer spending rose appreciably in the\\r\\n    quarter, and housing starts remained close to the highs\\r\\n    of the current expansion.  Business fixed investment\\r\\n    weakened following exceptionally strong increases in the\\r\\n    second and third quarters; nonfarm inventory accumulation\\r\\n    appears to have picked up somewhat.  The nominal deficit\\r\\n    on U.S. trade in goods and services narrowed significantly on average in October and November from its level\\r\\n    in the third quarter.  Price inflation has remained\\r\\n    subdued despite appreciably faster increases in worker\\r\\n    compensation in recent months.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\tMost interest rates have declined on balance since\\r\\n    the day before the Committee meeting on December 16,\\r\\n    1997.  Share prices in U.S. equity markets have moved up\\r\\n    somewhat over the period; equity markets in some other\\r\\n    countries, notably in Asia, have remained volatile.  In\\r\\n    foreign exchange markets, the value of the dollar has\\r\\n    risen over the intermeeting period relative to the\\r\\n    currencies of several Asian developing countries, but it\\r\\n    has registered only a small increase on average in\\r\\n    relation to the currencies of major industrial nations.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\tM2 and M3 continued to grow at relatively rapid\\r\\n    rates in December and apparently also in January.  From\\r\\n    the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997,\\r\\n    M2 expanded at a rate somewhat above the upper bound of\\r\\n    its range for the year and M3 at a rate substantially\\r\\n    above the upper bound of its range.  Total domestic\\r\\n    nonfinancial debt expanded in 1997 at a pace somewhat\\r\\n    below the middle of its range.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\tThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and\\r\\n    financial conditions that will foster price stability and\\r\\n    promote sustainable growth in output.  In furtherance of\\r\\n    these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established\\r\\n\\tranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent\\r\\n    and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth\\r\\n    quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.  The range\\r\\n    for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at\\r\\n    3 to 7 percent for the year.  The behavior of the\\r\\n    monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the\\r\\n    light of progress toward price level stability, movements\\r\\n    in their velocities, and developments in the economy and\\r\\n    financial markets.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\tIn the implementation of policy for the immediate\\r\\n    future, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets\\r\\n    consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an\\r\\n    average of around 5-1/2 percent.  In the context of the\\r\\n    Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability and\\r\\n    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration\\r\\n\\tto economic, financial, and monetary developments,\\r\\n    a slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower\\r\\n    federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting\\r\\n\\tperiod.  The contemplated reserve conditions are\\r\\n    expected to be consistent with some moderation in the\\r\\n    growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.\\r\\n\\nVotes for this action:  Messrs.
