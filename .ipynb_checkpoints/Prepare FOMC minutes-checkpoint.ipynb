Consumer spending, which had outpaced gains in household income for some time, was projected to slow to a growth rate more in line with the expansion of income; with pent-up demands apparently reduced and somewhat higher interest rates exerting a damping effect, much of the slowing was expected to be centered on outlays for durable goods. Business fixed investment would be restrained by the slower growth of business output and the associated moderation of corporate cash flows but would continue to advance at a faster rate than overall economic activity. Homebuilding was projected to remain at a pace that was relatively robust compared with the rate of recent years, though a bit below that of the fourth quarter. The restraint on output growth from federal spending cutbacks and weak export demand was expected to diminish somewhat.

       "  '[\" In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective developments, members commented on widespread indications, both statistical and anecdotal, of considerable momentum in the economic expansion. Business activity seemed to be rebounding smartly from the disruptive effects of unusually severe winter weather, and it appeared that the expansion over the first half of the year was likely to be a little stronger than had been expected at the time of the March meeting. A deceleration in activity still seemed to be in train for the second half, but the extent of such a slowing was an important source of uncertainty in the outlook. The members continued to see moderate growth at a rate in line with or slightly above the economy\\'s potential as the most likely prospect, but the overall momentum of the expansion and the still accommodative stance of monetary policy suggested that there was an appreciable risk of faster growth for a period, with consequent implications for greater pressures on resources. At the same time, the members saw relatively few signs of the kinds of imbalances that would pose a significant downside potential for the economy, although some cautioned that the rise in long-term interest rates, recently weaker data on production and sales, and continuing anxiety about job security in an environment of corporate restructuring contributed elements of fragility to what was otherwise a healthy outlook. The near-term prospects for inflation were favorable. Wage and price trends generally remained moderate; the persisting high rate of business investment bode well for further enhancements of productivity; and competitive pressures, including those from imported goods, were restraining efforts by firms to raise prices. The members were concerned, however, that in an environment in which slack in the economy already had been reduced to a fairly low level and could decline further in the quarters ahead, inflation could begin to rise unless monetary policy were adjusted further from its accommodative stance. \"]'),\n",

The rise in interest rates over the course of recent months was cited by business contacts as a potential source of restraint on interest-sensitive expenditures, but thus far relatively few contacts had reported actual examples of adverse interest-rate effects on spending. While higher rates would constrain aggregate demand going forward, their effects probably would be offset in part by more aggressive lending practices at banks and other institutions.

Some members noted, however, that sales had been less ebullient since late winter and cited factors that might work to restrain somewhat the growth of consumer spending. These included high and rising debt levels, declines in household wealth owing to the drop in stock and bond prices, and the effects on consumer confidence of ongoing workforce reductions associated with business restructuring. Higher interest rates also might limit the pace at which pent-up demands would continue to be satisfied.

With production straining capacity limits in a number of industries and firms striving for cost savings and productivity improvements to maintain their competitiveness, real outlays for producers\\' durable equipment were likely to stay on a strong upward trend despite an anticipated deceleration in business output and the recently increased cost of external capital associated with higher interest rates and lower equity prices. It was noted in this connection that order books at producers of capital equipment had grown considerably. Nonresidential construction appeared to be rebounding from the disruptive effects of unusually severe winter weather conditions; however, the pattern of construction activity across the nation was mixed, with some areas of the country displaying considerable strength in activity and other areas still depressed. The construction of office buildings for the most part remained at very low levels, but anecdotal reports indicated that markets for office space, especially those that had been hard hit in recent years, seemed to be improving considerably in some locales. Business inventories remained quite lean by historical standards, and some reports suggested that efforts to augment stocks had been negated by strong sales. With survey reports indicating that order backlogs had grown and lead times on materials deliveries had lengthened, the possibility was increasing that desired inventory ratios might be adjusted upward and some pickup in inventory investment might get under way, especially in manufacturing where stocks-to-sales ratios recently had fallen to new lows. \"]'),\n",

Production already had reached capacity limits in a number of industries, including motor vehicles and steel, and prices of some raw materials and intermediate goods had risen substantially over the past year. Ongoing efforts to expand production capacity through productivity-enhancing investment and the hiring of additional workers were likely to be of some help in meeting growing demands, but an increasing number of contacts were reporting that business firms were taking advantage of opportunities to adjust prices upward. There also were indications of shortages of qualified workers in some labor markets or industries, but to date there were only limited signs of upward wage pressures and these did not seem to signal a near-term emergence of general upward cost pressures on prices. Indeed, even with sales strong, many business contacts were reporting that intense competition, in part from imports, was curbing or negating efforts to raise prices. Firms were continuing to look primarily to improvements in productivity and quality to bolster their profit margins, although there also were reports that price discounting was lessening and that sales promotions were becoming less frequent.

Many members commented that the expansion was on a solid and self-sustaining basis and appeared to have more underlying strength than they had foreseen earlier. The stimulative effects of an expansionary monetary policy had become increasingly apparent--especially in business purchases of capital equipment and consumer spending on housing, motor vehicles, and other consumer durables. At the same time, the constraints on economic expansion that had been associated with business restructuring activities, widespread efforts to strengthen balance sheets, and other retarding forces had diminished considerably. The financial health of the banking system was greatly improved, and banking institutions had evidenced a growing willingness to make new loans. Moreover, the demand for bank loans, which had been sluggish for several years, now appeared to be on the rise. While a series of small steps earlier this year had already reduced the degree of accommodation in monetary policy and inflation was subdued for the time being, the members were concerned that continued policy accommodation could be expected to lead before long to growing pressures on production resources and to a fresh outbreak of inflation. \"]'),\n",

The actions taken earlier in the year had been modest in size because of concerns that more aggressive steps might generate substantial uncertainty and undue disruptions in financial markets, with adverse consequences for the economy. Even though financial markets remained volatile, speculative sentiment and holdings seemed to have been reduced to a marked extent, and financial markets appeared to be in a much better position to absorb needed policy adjustments. Accordingly, a stronger action probably would not produce an unduly adverse market response and could well have a settling effect on the markets. A number of members cautioned that the Committee could not be sure that today\\'s policy actions, along with those implemented earlier this year, had produced a policy stance that would foster economic growth at a sustainable, non-inflationary pace.
